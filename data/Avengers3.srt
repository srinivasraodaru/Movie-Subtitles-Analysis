Boom.

193

six elemental crystals...

194

hurtling across
the virgin universe.

195

Tell me his name again.

204
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,640
Thanos.

205
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
He's a plague, Tony.

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,040
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

207
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,360
He wipes out
half the population.

208
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,240
He sent Loki.

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,760
The attack on New York,
that's him.

210
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
This is it.

211
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
What's our timeline?

212
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,960
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

213
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
That already makes him

214
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,160
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,400
He could destroy life

217
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,520
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

218
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

219

-(CLANGS)

221

I'm going to allow that.

222
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

223
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

224
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
No can do.

225
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,280
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

A bit chalky.

230
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

231
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,320
-That's a thing?
-Whatever.

232
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,560
Point is, things change.

233
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,480
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

234
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,680
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

235
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Yeah, so conversely,

236
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
it may also be
his best chance against us.

237
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,280
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

238

What is your job exactly?

239

Besides making
balloon animals.

241

Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

242
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
The fact is
we have this stone.

243
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,920
We know where it is.

244
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,640
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

245
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,520
and we have to find him now.

What do you mean?

248
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,120
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
He's offline.

250

-What?
-Yeah.

251
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,760
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

252
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,200
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

253
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
Who could find Vision then?

00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,200
This... This is a man.

489
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,320
A handsome, muscular man.

490
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I'm muscular.

491
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

492
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

493
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
PETER: Yeah, right.

494
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,720
DRAX: It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

495
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
What?

496
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Gamora, do you think I'm...

497
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,800
He is anxious, angry.

498
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

499
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,480
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

500
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
PETER: Wow.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,600
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

502
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

503
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,680
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

504
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,120
ROCKET: You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

505
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,480
GAMORA: It's like his muscles

506
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,480
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

507
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,360
Stop massaging his muscles.

508
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,080
(THUD)

509
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Wake him up.

510
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
(SOFTLY) Wake.

Who the hell are you guys?

516
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,520
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

517
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,400
To bring balance
to the universe

518
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
by wiping out
half of all life.

519
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,760
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

520
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,240
massacre by massacre.

521
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,920
Including my own.

522
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,640
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

523
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,040
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

524
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,640
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

525
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

526
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,720
Your father killed my brother.

527
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh, boy.

528
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,080
Stepfather, technically.

529
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,160
And she hates him
as much as you do.

530
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,440
THOR: Families can be tough.

531
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,920
Before my father died,

532
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,760
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

533
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,200
that he imprisoned in Hel.

534
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,320
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

535
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,760
So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,000
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

537
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,320
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,600
I feel your pain as well,
because...

540
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
I mean,
it's not a competition,

541
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,160
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,000
-My father killed my mother.
-(SLURPING)

543
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,280
And then I had to kill
my father.

544
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
-That was hard.
-(SIGHS)

545
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,920
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

546
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,360
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

547
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,200
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,160
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

549
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,240
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

550
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,680
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Taking your pod.

(IN DEEP VOICE)
No, you're not.

553
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,200
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

554
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,080
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

555
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,640
-No.
-You are.

556
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,480
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

557
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,840
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
-(GASPS) He just did it again!
-This is my voice.

559
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,600
-Are you mocking me?
-Stop it. You did it again.

561
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,160
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,960
-GAMORA: Enough!
-He's doing it first.

564
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
We need to stop Thanos.

565
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Which means
we need to find out

566
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
where he's going next.

567
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,720
Knowhere.

568
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,560
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, no. Knowhere?

570
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,560
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

571
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,160
-Excuse me, that's our food.
-Not anymore.

572
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,760
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

573
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,080
THOR: Because for years...

574
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,400
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

575
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,920
with a man
called the Collector.

576
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,680
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

577
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,560
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

578
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
-Or a genius.
-GAMORA: How do you know...

579
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,800
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

580
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,360
There are six stones
out there.

581
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,720
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

582
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,160
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

583
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,680
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

584
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,520
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

585
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,320
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

586
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
They're with the Avengers.

587
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,000
-The Avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.

588
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,280
Like Kevin Bacon?

589
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,720
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

590
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,800
I haven't been there
in a while.

591
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,200
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

592
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,000
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,920
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,440
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

595
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,040
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

596
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
You're welcome.

597
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,640
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

598
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,480
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

599
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,760
-That's a made-up word.
-All words are made up.

600
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,000
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,800
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

603
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,520
(CHUCKLING)
to ever torment the universe.

604
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,720
I would very much like
to go there, please.

605
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,040
and clearly the smartest
among you.

607
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,160
Rabbit?

608
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,560
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

609
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,920
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

610
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,480
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,160
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

613
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,120
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

614
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,040
-Yeah. I'll go.
-Wonderful!

615
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,320
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

616
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
THOR: Quiet.

617
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,080
-That's my backpack.
-ROCKET: Go sit down.

618
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,880
PETER: Look, this is my ship.

619
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,800
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,880
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

621
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,280
The Thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,640
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

623
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,840
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

624
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,080
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,360
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

626
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,440
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

627
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,760
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
If we don't go to Knowhere

629
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,840
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

630
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,560
he'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,880
-He already is.
-I got it figured out.

632
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,760
We got two ships

633
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,240
and a large assortment
of morons.

634
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,640
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

635
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,000
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

636
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,640
to try to stop Thanos.

637
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
-Cool? Cool.
-So cool.

638
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,200
PETER: For the record...

639
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
I know that
you're going with him

640
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,440
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

641
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,120
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,320
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

643
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,640
Come on, Groot.

644
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,880
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

645
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,320

I've mastered the ability

813
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,160
of standing
so incredibly still...

814
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960
that I become
invisible to the eye.

But my movement...

818
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,440
was so slow...

819
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,120
that it's imperceptible.

820

I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

I sold it.

838
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Why would I lie?

839
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,320
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

840
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,880
Like suicide.

841
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,520
You do understand.

842
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

843
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,040
I didn't know what it was.

844
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,000
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

845
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
It's him.

He doesn't have the stone yet.

857
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,000
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

858
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,000
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,120
Then we have to protect it.

977
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,920
No, we have to destroy it.

978
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,360
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

979
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,440
to this entity in my head.

980
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,120
About its nature.

981
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,840
But also its composition.

982
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I think if it were exposed

983
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,920
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

984
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,920
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

985
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,680
its molecular integrity
could fail.

986
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,480
Yeah, and you with it.

987
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,400
We're not having
this conversation.

988
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,560
VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

989
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,640
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

990
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,400
That's too high a price.

991
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,280
Only you have
the power to pay it.

992
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,600
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

993
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,280
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

994
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,880
But it should.

995
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,760
We don't trade lives, Vision.

996
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,880
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

997
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,840
to save how many
millions of people?

998
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,040
Tell me,
why is this any different?

999
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,520
BANNER: Because you might
have a choice.

1000
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,160
Your mind is made up

1001
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,600
of a complex construct
of overlays.

1002
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,360
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

1003
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,280
All of them mixed together,

1004
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,840
all of them
learning from one another.

1005
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,000
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

1006
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,240
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

1007
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,840
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

1008
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,360
Perhaps the best parts.

1009
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,040
Can we do that?

1010
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,800
Not me, not here.

1011
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,320
RHODES: Well,
you better find someone

1012
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
and somewhere fast.

1013
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,120
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

1014
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,400
have your old rooms back.

1015
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,040
I know somewhere.

1016
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,960
OKOYE: The Kingsguard

1017
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,320
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

1018
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,040
And the Border Tribe?

1019
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,080
Those that are left.

1020
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,480
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

1021
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,760
M'Baku likes a good fight.

And what of this one?

1024
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,520
This one may be tired of war.

1025
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,880
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

1026
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,120
Where's the fight?

1027
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,440
On its way.

In all the time
I've served Thanos...

1031
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
I have never failed him.

1032
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,480
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

1033
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,240
with the Time Stone
still attached

1034

irritating person...

(GRUNTS)

1039
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,200
the stone.

1040
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,040
Wow, you're a seriously

1041
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,240
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

speaking of loyalty...

STARK: What the...

1044
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,880
-I know what you're gonna say.
-You should not be here.

1045
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,120
-I was gonna go home.
-I don't wanna hear it.

1046
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,280
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

1047
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,600
-about you on the way...
-And now I gotta hear it.

1048
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,680
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

1049
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,920

intuitive, by the way.

God damn it.

1051
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,040
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

-What did you just say?
-(STUTTERS) I take that back.

And now, I'm here in space.

1054

Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

1058
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
No, I did think this through.

1059
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,680
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

1060

You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

how you fit your head
into that helmet.

ducked out when I told you to.

I tried to bench you.
You refused.

Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,760
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1120
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,920
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,560
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1122
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,880
I don't think
you quite understand

1123
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,960
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,480
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1125
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,400
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,120
Since he sent an army
to New York

1127
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,760
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,840
And I don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,200
So I'm not so sure

1130
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,040
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,840
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1132
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,240
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,160
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1134
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
Doctor.

1135
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,680
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,760
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1137
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,880
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,720
if it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,240
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1140
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,240
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,760
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1142
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,240
Nice. Good, moral compass.

1144
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,640
(SIGHS) All right, kid.

1145
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,960
You're an Avenger now.

1146
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,840
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1147
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,560
I always hated that chair.

1148
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,800
THANOS: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,360
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,680
I hated this room.

1151
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,840
This ship.

1152
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,800
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,480
THANOS: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,000
Every day.

1155
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,760
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,720
I was a child
when you took me.

1157
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,960
I saved you.

1158
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
No.

1159
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,480
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1160
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,840
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,040
scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,080
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1163
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,240
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,560
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1165
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,360
The children born...

1166
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,360
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1167
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,760
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,320
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1169
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,360
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1170
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,520
You're insane.

1171
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,640
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1172
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,600
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1173
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,160
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1174
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,640
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,200
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,800
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1177
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,800
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1178
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,360
For a time...

1179
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,200
you had that same will...

1180
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,240
as you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,160
Daughter.

1182
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,720
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,880
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1184
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,120
And, in doing so,

1185
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,440
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1186
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,200
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1187
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,040
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1189
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,360
I am disappointed.

1190
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,640
But not because
you didn't find it.

1191
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,960
But because you did.

1192

And you lied.

your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

Please don't do this.

1198

THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

1199
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,840
So I brought her here.

1200
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,640

So, dead brother, huh?

Yeah, that could be annoying.

Well, he's been dead before.

But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

had better be up there.

For your sister's sake.

THANOS: You know us?

It is my curse to know all

1490
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,400
it extracts a terrible price.

1491
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,320
I am prepared.

I even held one in my hand.

banished me here.

RED SKULL: The price.

1503
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,880
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1504
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,960
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1505

THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1506

RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1507
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,600
understands its power...

1508
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,280
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1509
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,000
Of what?

1510
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,400
In order to take the stone,

1511
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,880
you must lose
that which you love.

1512
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,120

01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,400
a moment...

1517
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,840
when you got
what you deserved.

1518
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,320
And I was always
so disappointed.

1519
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,400
But now...

1520
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,440
You kill and torture...

1521
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,400
and you call it mercy.

1522
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,560
The universe has judged you.

1523
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,600
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1524
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,640
You failed.

1525
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,920
And do you wanna know why?

1526
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,720
Because you love nothing.

1527
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,040
No one.

1528
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,840
No.

01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,280

1535
