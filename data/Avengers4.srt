1
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,080
Ok, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,297
You see where you're going?

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:13,560
Ok.

4
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:15,635
Now, let's worry about
how you get there.

5
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:18,190
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:19,757
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,072
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,164
Ok?

9
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:25,069
Can you see?

10
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,603
Yeah.
Are you sure?

11
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,574
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,746
No.
How about now?

13
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:32,736
Alright.

14
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:34,524
Ready?

15
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,514
Three fingers.

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,487
Nice!

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,588
Nice throw, kiddo.

18
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:41,748
Here you go.

19
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,765
Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard?

20
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:45,523
Or both?

21
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,259
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

22
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,406
Probably your brothers.

23
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,739
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

24
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:52,642
Got it!

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,110
Nate, mayo or mustard?

26
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,702
How about ketchup?

27
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,144
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

28
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,391
Mind your elbow.

29
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,640
Good job, hawk-eye.

30
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:05,658
Go get your arrow.

31
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:10,269
Hey, guys!

32
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:11,707
Enough practice.

33
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:12,656
Soup's on!

34
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,930
Alright.

35
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,703
We're coming.
We're hungry.

36
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,687
Lila, let's go.

37
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:21,926
Lila?

38
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:26,188
Honey?

39
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,218
Hey, babe?

40
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:41,575
Babe?

41
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:44,904
Babe?

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,932
Boys!

43
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,208
Boys!

44
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:54,297
Laura!

45
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:39,807
You don't need to do that.

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,939
Because, you're just
holding the position.

47
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,085
Only that.

48
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,737
That was close.

49
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,214
That's a goal.

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,220
We are now one apiece.

51
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:51,638
I would like to try again.

52
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:56,304
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

53
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:57,236
It's fun.

54
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,139
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

55
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,511
And you've won.

56
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,444
Congratulations.

57
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,703
Fair game.

58
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:08,297
Good sport.

59
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:10,752
You have fun?

60
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:14,033
It was fun.

61
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,494
This thing on?

62
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,072
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

63
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,600
If you find this recording...

64
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,599
don't post it...

65
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,808
on social media.
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

66
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,503
I don't know if you're ever
gonna see these.

67
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,808
I don't even know if you're still...

68
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,282
Oh God, I hope so.

69
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,452
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

70
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,740
<i>No, 22.</i>

71
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,424
<i>You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror,</i>

72
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,860
<i>of staring into the literal void of space,</i>

73
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,652
<i>I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.</i>

74
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,520
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

75
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,537
<i>thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

76
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,336
<i>You'd love her.</i>

77
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,796
<i>Very practical.</i>

78
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,427
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

79
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,080
<i>So, the fuel cells were cracked</i>

80
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,882
<i>during battle and we figured out
a way to reverse the ion charge...</i>

81
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:34,374
<i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i>

82
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:39,769
<i>But it's now dead in the water.</i>

83
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,175
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

84
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,011
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

85
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,093
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

86
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,906
<i>And Pep, I...</i>

87
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,560
<i>I know I said no more surprises but,</i>

88
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,362
<i>I got to say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.</i>

89
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,207
<i>But it looks like...</i>

90
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,770
<i>Well, you know what it looks like.</i>

91
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:07,718
Don't feel bad about this.

92
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:10,407
I mean actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

93
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:14,392
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

94
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:22,169
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

95
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,399
Go rest my eyes.

96
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,184
Please know...

97
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:32,780
when I drift off,
it'll be like every night lately.

98
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:35,976
I'm fine. Totally fine.

99
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,446
I dream about you.

100
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:41,573
Because it's always you.

101
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,652
Couldn't stop him.

102
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:06,363
Neither could I.

103
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:07,821
Hang on.

104
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:11,555
I lost the kid.

105
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:15,799
Tony, we lost.

106
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,285
Is...

107
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:21,960
Good.
Oh my God!

108
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,311
Oh my God!

109
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:30,741
It's ok.

110
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,907
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

111
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,746
World governments are in pieces.

112
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,813
The parts that are still working...

113
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:50,341
are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

114
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,388
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

115
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,656
Thanos wiped out...

116
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:01,579
50% of all living creatures.

117
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:07,320
Where is he now? Where?

118
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:09,211
We don't know.

119
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,720
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

120
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,882
What's wrong with him?

121
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:18,872
He's pissed.

122
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:21,478
He thinks he failed.

123
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:23,995
Which of course he did,

124
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:26,101
but there is a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

125
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,070
Honestly, until this exact second
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

126
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:29,996
Maybe I am.

127
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,164
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

128
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,654
Deep space scans...

129
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:36,025
and satellites, and we got nothing.

130
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,536
Tony, you fought him.

131
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:40,637
Who told you that?

132
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:41,993
I didn't fight him.

133
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,067
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

134
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,369
while the Bleecker Street
magician gave away the store.

135
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,883
That's what happened.
There was no fight,

136
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:49,097
because he's not beatable.
Ok.

137
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:52,038
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

138
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,178
I saw this coming a few years back.

139
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,862
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

140
00:10:58,865 --> 00:10:59,853
Thought I was dreaming.

141
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,322
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.
And I needed you.

142
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,837
As in past tense, that trumps,

143
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,558
what you need, it's too late buddy.

144
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:08,849
Sorry.

145
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,567
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

146
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,336
And I believe I rememeber telling.

147
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,865
Tony, Tony, Tony...
Oh yes.

148
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,387
Why that otherwise,

149
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,149
that what we needed,

150
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,231
was a suit of armor around
the world. Remember that?

151
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,713
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms,

152
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,641
or not. That's what we needed.

153
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,198
Well that didn't work out, did it?
I said we'd lose.

154
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,945
You said, We'll do that together, too.

155
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:34,476
Well guess what, Cap?

156
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:35,780
We lost.

157
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,568
You weren't there.

158
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,290
But that's what we do, right?

159
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,733
Our best work after the fact?

160
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,208
We're the Avengers?

161
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,460
We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

162
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:46,897
Ok. You made your point.
Right?

163
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,837
Just sit down, ok?
Ok.

164
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:48,834
No, no. Here's my...
Tony, sit.

165
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,350
She's great by the way.
Sit down!

166
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,053
We need you.
You're new blood.

167
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:53,215
Bunch of tired old mills...

168
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:56,716
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

169
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:59,531
no clues, no strategies, no options.

170
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,055
Zero. Zip. Nada.

171
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,548
No trust, you liar...

172
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,108
You take this.

173
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,861
You find him and you put that on.

174
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,688
You hide.

175
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:15,921
Tony!
I'm fine.

176
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,443
I...

177
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,221
Bruce gave him a sedative.

178
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,300
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

179
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:30,428
You guys take care of him.

180
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,275
And I'll bring an Bezurian
elixir when I come back.

181
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:35,398
Where are you going?
To kill Thanos.

182
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:39,382
Hey.

183
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:42,125
You know we usually work
as a team here and...

184
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,124
between you and I
we're also a little fragile.

185
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,613
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight too.

186
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,296
You even know where he is?
I know people who might.

187
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,392
Don't bother.

188
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,342
I can tell you where Thanos is.

189
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,928
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

190
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,625
Then when he worked,
he talked about...

191
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,237
his great plan.

192
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,316
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

193
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,115
I'd ask,

194
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,154
where would we go once
his plan was complete?

195
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,977
His answer was always the same.

196
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,631
To The Garden.

197
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,187
That's cute.

198
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,921
Thanos has a retirement plan.

199
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:24,980
So where is he?

200
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,692
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

201
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:32,134
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

202
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,792
No one's ever seen anything like it...

203
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,159
until two days ago.

204
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,002
On this planet.

205
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,389
Thanos is there.

206
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:44,795
He used the stones again.

207
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,305
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

208
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,157
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

209
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,781
Look, he still got the stones, so...

210
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:51,803
So let's get him.

211
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:53,987
We use them to bring everyone back.

212
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:54,966
Just like that?

213
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,796
Yeah. Just like that.

214
00:13:57,026 --> 00:14:00,371
Even if there is a small chance
that we can undo this...

215
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,780
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

216
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:07,260
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

217
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,020
Because before, you didn't have me.

218
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:14,009
Hey new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

219
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:16,896
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

220
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,969
There are a lot of other planets
in the universe.

221
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,644
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

222
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,864
I like this one.

223
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:50,488
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

224
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:13,892
Ok.

225
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,625
Who here hasn't been to space?

226
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,634
You better not throw up on my ship.

227
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,491
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

228
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,733
I'll head down for recon.

229
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,864
This is gonna work Steve.

230
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,400
I know it will.

231
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,303
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

232
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,498
No satellites,

233
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,511
no ships,

234
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,607
no armies, no ground defenses
of any kind.

235
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,723
It's just him.

236
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,159
Then that's enough.

237
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,856
Oh no.

238
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,024
Where are they?

239
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,357
Answer the question.

240
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,895
The universe required correction.

241
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,730
After that,

242
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:11,864
the stones served no purpose,

243
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:13,855
beyond temptation.

244
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:15,216
You murdered trillions!

245
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,339
You should be grateful.

246
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:23,930
Where are the stones?

247
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:25,563
Gone.

248
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,713
Reduced to atoms.

249
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,584
You used them two days ago.

250
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:32,711
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

251
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,462
It nearly killed me.

252
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,314
But the work is done.

253
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,461
It always will be.

254
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,269
I am inevitable.

255
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:51,187
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

256
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,698
My father is many things.

257
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,969
A liar is not one of them.

258
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,692
Thank you, Daughter.

259
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,010
Perhaps I treated you too harshly...

260
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,075
What...

261
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,106
What did you do?

262
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:18,721
I went for the head.

263
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,145
So I...

264
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,680
Went on a date the other day.

265
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:38,341
It's the first time in five years,
you know?

266
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,480
Sit there, dinner...

267
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,689
I didn't know what to talk about.

268
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,076
What did you talk about?

269
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,786
Same old crap, you know?

270
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,371
How things have changed and...

271
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,939
My job, his job...

272
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,326
How much we miss the Mets.

273
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,934
Then things get quiet..

274
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:04,190
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

275
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:06,030
What about you?

276
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,299
I cried just before dessert.

277
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:16,786
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

278
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:17,816
That's great.

279
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,507
You did the hardest part.

280
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,789
You took the jump, you didn't know
where you were gonna come down.

281
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,920
And that's it.
That's those little...

282
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:27,049
brave baby steps you got to take.

283
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:30,874
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

284
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:36,153
I went in the ice in '45 right after
I met the love of my life.

285
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,601
Woke up 70 years later.

286
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,071
You got to move on.

287
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,680
Got to move on.

288
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,441
The world is in our hands.

289
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,714
It's left to us guys.

290
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,503
And we got to do something with it.

291
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:02,897
Otherwise...

292
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:05,999
Thanos should have killed all of us.

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,780
What the hell?

294
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:23,043
Hope?

295
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,618
Kid!

296
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,014
Hey, kid!

297
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:04,770
What the hell happened here?

298
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:38,210
My God...

299
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:42,929
No. Please.

300
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:44,621
Please, please.

301
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:46,160
No, no, no.

302
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,236
No.

303
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:49,362
No.

304
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,759
Excuse me. Sorry.

305
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,919
No, Cassie, no.

306
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:56,369
No.

307
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:58,603
No, no.

308
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,210
Please, please, please, please, please.

309
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,212
Please. No, Cassie.

310
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:11,599
What?

311
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:42,820
Cassie?

312
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,050
Dad?

313
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:13,138
You're so big!

314
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,051
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

315
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,977
It was an infectious garbage scowl.

316
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,559
So, thanks for the hot tip.

317
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:36,859
Well, you were closer.

318
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,588
Yeah.
And now we smell like garbage.

319
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,401
You get a reading on those tremors?

320
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:42,895
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

321
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:45,101
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

322
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:48,392
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

323
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:51,370
We handle it by not handling it.

324
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:54,872
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

325
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:55,944
Not likely.

326
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:57,951
What, you gonna get another haircut?

327
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,250
Listen, fur-face.

328
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,359
I'm covering a lot of territory.

329
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,192
The things that are happening on Earth

330
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:04,578
are happening everywhere,

331
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,403
on thousands of planets.

332
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,610
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

333
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,624
So you might not see
me for a long time.

334
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,414
Alright.

335
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:14,543
Well...

336
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,834
This channel is always active.

337
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,924
So, anything goes sideways...

338
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,533
Anyone's making trouble
where they should not...

339
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,470
Comes through me.

340
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:24,953
Ok.
Ok.

341
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:25,969
Alright.

342
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:28,356
Good luck.

343
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,040
Where are you?

344
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:39,112
Mexico.

345
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:41,723
The federales found a room
full of bodies.

346
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:43,084
Looks like a...

347
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:46,154
bunch of cartel guys. Never even
had the chance to get their guns off.

348
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:47,749
It's probably a rival gang.

349
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:49,471
Except it isn't.

350
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:50,997
It's definitely Barton.

351
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,404
What he's done here,

352
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:56,507
what he's been doing
for the last few years,

353
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,651
I mean, the scene that he left...

354
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,653
I got to tell you, there is a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

355
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,563
Will you find out where he's going next?

356
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:16,893
Nat...

357
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:19,489
Please.

358
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,220
Ok.

359
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,227
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner but...

360
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,225
you seem pretty miserable already.

361
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,599
You here to do your laundry?

362
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:42,988
And to see a friend.

363
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:45,902
Clearly, your friend is fine.

364
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:52,498
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

365
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,491
In the Hudson?

366
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:55,465
There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

367
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:57,700
You know, if you're about to tell me...

368
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,527
to look on the bright side...

369
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,969
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

370
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:08,729
Sorry.

371
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,259
Force of habit.

372
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,468
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and...

373
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,051
grow.

374
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:31,797
Some do.

375
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:36,757
But not us.

376
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:39,472
If I move on, who does this?

377
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:41,905
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

378
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,052
I used to have nothing.

379
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,493
And then I got this.

380
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,272
This job.

381
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,522
This family.

382
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:04,948
And I was...

383
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:07,444
I was better because of it.

384
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,196
And even though...

385
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:17,669
they're gone...

386
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:23,528
Now, I'm still trying to be better.

387
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:28,738
I think we both need to get a life.

388
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:32,977
You first.

389
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:39,881
<i>Hi. Hi!</i>

390
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,145
<i>Is anyone home?</i>

391
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:42,705
<i>This is Scott Lang.</i>

392
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:45,846
<i>We met a few years ago,
at the airport?</i>

393
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,356
<i>In Germany?</i>

394
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:50,680
<i>I was the guy that got really big
and I had my mask on.</i>

395
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,082
<i>You would not recognize me.</i>
Is this an old message?

396
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:53,049
<i>Ant-Man?</i>

397
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:55,186
<i>Ant-Man, I know you know.
I know you know that.</i>

398
00:30:55,261 --> 00:30:56,284
It's the front gate.

399
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:57,918
<i>I need to talk to you guys.</i>

400
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,950
Scott.

401
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,004
Are you ok?
Yeah.

402
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,519
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

403
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:14,426
Only in mid-conversation.

404
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,566
Alright. So...

405
00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:18,686
Five years ago,

406
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:20,134
Right, right before...

407
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:21,912
Thanos,

408
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:24,247
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

409
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:27,553
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

410
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,645
To get in there, you have to be

411
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:30,975
incredibly small.
Hope, she's my...

412
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:34,536
She was... she was my...

413
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,007
She. She was supposed
to pull me out.

414
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:39,944
And then, Thanos happened and

415
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:41,479
I got stuck in there.

416
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:43,770
Sorry.
That must've been a long 5 years.

417
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,879
Yeah, but that's just it.

418
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:46,341
It wasn't.

419
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,077
For me it was five hours.

420
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,856
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

421
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,796
Everything is unpredictable.
Is that anybody's sandwich?

422
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:55,003
I'm starving.

423
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:56,366
Scott.

424
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:57,953
What are you talking about?

425
00:31:59,247 --> 00:31:59,969
So...

426
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:02,663
What I'm saying is...

427
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,987
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

428
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,807
The only problem is right now,

429
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:09,683
we don't have a way to navigate it.

430
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,137
But what if we did?

431
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:12,753
I can't stop thinking about it.

432
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:14,490
What if we could somehow control...

433
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:16,190
the chaos and we could navigate it?

434
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:18,709
What if there was a way
that we can enter

435
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,682
the quantum realm
at a certain point in time,

436
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:22,301
but then exit the quantum realm

437
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:23,669
at another point in time?

438
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,619
Like...

439
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:26,955
Like before Thanos.

440
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,381
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

441
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:32,847
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

442
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,121
It's more like a...

443
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,684
Yeah, a time machine.

444
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:39,470
I know it's crazy. It's crazy.

445
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:40,245
But I...

446
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:41,738
But I can't stop thinking about it.

447
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,949
There's got to be...

448
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,050
Some wa...

449
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:46,943
It's crazy.
Scott.

450
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,514
I get e-mails from a raccoon.

451
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,692
So, nothing sounds crazy anymore.

452
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,370
So who do we talk to about this?

453
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:12,653
Chow-time!

454
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:16,315
Morgoona.

455
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,509
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

456
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:25,761
Define lunch or be disintegrated.
Ok.

457
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,323
You should not be wearing that, ok?

458
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:31,025
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

459
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,793
There you go.
Are you thinking about lunch?

460
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:38,984
I can give you a handful of crickets.

461
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:40,190
On a bed of lettuce.
No.

462
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,219
That's what you want.

463
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,663
How did you find this?

464
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,808
Garage.

465
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,577
Really?

466
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:47,207
Were you looking for it?

467
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:47,948
No.

468
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:49,899
I found it, though.

469
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,219
You like going to the garage?

470
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,835
So does Daddy.

471
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:55,834
It's fine actually.

472
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:57,423
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

473
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,362
So, I'm gonna...

474
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,644
No. We know what it sounds like.

475
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,862
Tony, after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible?

476
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:26,148
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

477
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,971
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

478
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:28,887
Can we agree on that?

479
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,132
Thank you.

480
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:31,857
In layman's terms, it means,

481
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:32,986
you're not coming home.

482
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,240
I did.
No.

483
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:35,721
You accidentally survived.

484
00:34:36,227 --> 00:34:38,047
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

485
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,002
And now you wanna pull a...

486
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:41,832
What do you call it?

487
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:45,123
A time heist?

488
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:46,531
Yeah, a time heist.

489
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:47,543
Of course.

490
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,578
Why didn't we think of this before?

491
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:51,514
Because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

492
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:53,017
The stones are in the past.

493
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,131
We could go back, we could get them.

494
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:57,295
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

495
00:34:57,437 --> 00:34:59,481
Or screw it up worse
than he already has, right?

496
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:00,711
I don't believe we would.

497
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,776
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

498
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,300
However, high hopes won't help...

499
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,434
if there is no logical, tangible way

500
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:10,588
for me to safely execute said...

501
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,000
time heist.

502
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,074
I believe the most likely outcome,

503
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:15,310
will be our collective demise.

504
00:35:15,312 --> 00:35:17,694
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

505
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,357
It means no talking to our past...

506
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,401
selves no betting on sporting events.

507
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,466
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

508
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,793
Are you seriously telling me,

509
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,599
that your plan to save the universe...

510
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,322
is based on, Back to the Future?

511
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:32,289
Is it?

512
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:33,289
No.

513
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,649
Good. You had me worried there.
Because that would be horseshit.

514
00:35:35,998 --> 00:35:37,967
That's not how quantum physics works.

515
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:38,954
Tony.

516
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,842
We have to take a stand.

517
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:44,439
We did stand.

518
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:45,892
And yet, here we are.

519
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:49,331
I know you got a lot on the line.

520
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,527
You got a wife, a daughter.

521
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,374
But I lost someone very important to me.

522
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,309
A lotta people did.

523
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,377
And now,

524
00:35:57,379 --> 00:35:59,826
now we have a chance
to bring her back...

525
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:01,085
to bring everyone back,

526
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,694
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

527
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:04,490
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

528
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:07,143
I can't.

529
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,634
Mommy told me to come
and save you.

530
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:12,944
Good job.

531
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:14,439
I'm saved.

532
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,327
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

533
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:18,434
Anything else.

534
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,468
I'm honestly happy to see you guys,
I just...

535
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:21,630
look, the table's set for six.

536
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,141
Tony. I get it.

537
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,844
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

538
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,354
But this is a second chance.

539
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,681
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

540
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,039
Can't roll the dice on it.

541
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,277
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

542
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,544
Well, he's scared.

543
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:43,125
He's not wrong.

544
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,532
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

545
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:46,879
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

546
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,223
No, I wanna do it right.

547
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,719
We're gonna need a really big brain.

548
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,838
Bigger than his?

549
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,310
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

550
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:00,084
Try some of that.

551
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,553
Have some eggs.

552
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,389
I'm so confused.

553
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,753
These are confusing times.

554
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:06,071
Right, no, no, no, no.

555
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,227
No that's not what I meant.

556
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,770
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

557
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,888
I know, it's crazy.

558
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:13,738
I'm wearing shirts now.

559
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,652
Yeah. What? How? Why?

560
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,010
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

561
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:21,444
Except it was worse for me...

562
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,817
because I lost twice.

563
00:37:23,062 --> 00:37:24,855
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

564
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,246
and then, we all lost.

565
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,499
No one blamed you, Bruce.

566
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,738
I did.

567
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:34,377
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease,

568
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,633
something to get rid of.

569
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,157
But then I start looking
at him as the cure.

570
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,845
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

571
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,459
I put the brains and the brawn together...

572
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,181
and now, look at me.

573
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,664
Best of both worlds.

574
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,769
Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
Yes.

575
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,146
Can we. Can we get a photo?

576
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,385
100%, little person.

577
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,799
Come on, step on up.

578
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:56,794
Do you mind?

579
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,486
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.

580
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:00,275
Say green.

581
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,323
Green.
Green.

582
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,408
Did you get that?

583
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:05,672
That's a good one.

584
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,728
Did you want to grab one with me?

585
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:09,050
I'm Ant-Man.

586
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,366
They're Hulk fans.
Wait.

587
00:38:13,368 --> 00:38:14,313
They don't know Ant-Man.
No. No. I...

588
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,548
Nobody does. Nobody does.
Don't feel bad.

589
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,208
No. He wants,

590
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,308
you to take a picture with him.
I don't want a picture.

591
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,266
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

592
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:21,089
I get it.
Come on.

593
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,512
I don't want it, either.
The kids... But you...

594
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:23,949
I don't want a picture with them.
But...

595
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,253
He's gonna feel bad.
Sorry.

596
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,762
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

597
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:27,932
No I don't want to do it.
We can do it.

598
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:28,992
No, you feel bad.

599
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,036
Take the goddamn phone.

600
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:30,967
Ok.

601
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:32,873
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

602
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,576
No, it was great, kids.
Thank you very much.

603
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:36,140
Hulk out!

604
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,374
Bruce.

605
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,947
Dab.

606
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,986
Bruce.
Listen to your mom.

607
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,362
She knows better.

608
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:43,527
About what we were saying.

609
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,074
Right.

610
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,647
The whole time travel do-over?

611
00:38:51,402 --> 00:38:54,286
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

612
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:56,960
Well, you pulled this off.

613
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,831
I remember a time when
that seemed pretty impossible, too.

614
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,556
I've got a mild inspiration.

615
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:37,877
I'd like to see if it checks out.

616
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:38,867
So,

617
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,680
I'd like to run one last SIM
before we pack it in for the night.

618
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:44,930
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

619
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:46,390
inverted, please.

620
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:47,636
<i>Processing.</i>

621
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,667
Right, give me the eigenvalue,

622
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:55,511
of that particle
factoring in spectral decomp.

623
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,896
That'll take a second.
<i>Just a moment.</i>

624
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,738
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

625
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,388
<i>Model rendered.</i>

626
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:17,461
Shit!

627
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,844
Shit!

628
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,007
What are you doing up, little miss?

629
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:25,812
Shit.

630
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,048
Nope. We don't say that.

631
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,260
Only Mommy says that word.

632
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,886
She coined it. It belongs to her.

633
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,013
Why are you up?

634
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,017
Because I've got some important shit
going on here!

635
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:33,849
Why do you think?

636
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,342
No I got, I got something on my mind.

637
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:36,977
I got. I got something on my mind.

638
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,687
Was it juice pops?

639
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,153
Sure was.

640
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,610
That's extortion. That's a word.

641
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,726
What kind you want?

642
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,155
Great minds think alike.

643
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:48,563
Juice pops exactly...

644
00:40:48,728 --> 00:40:49,530
was on...

645
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:52,307
my mind.

646
00:40:53,553 --> 00:40:54,940
You done? Yeah?

647
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,469
Now you are.

648
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,189
Here. Wipe.

649
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:01,877
Good.

650
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,010
That face goes there.

651
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:05,069
Tell me a story.

652
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:06,118
A story.

653
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,211
Once upon a time,

654
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:09,302
Maguna went to bed. The end.

655
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,125
That is a horrible story.

656
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:12,879
Come on, that's your favorite story.

657
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,670
Love you tons.

658
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,442
I love you 3,000.

659
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,156
3,000. That's crazy.

660
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,159
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

661
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,405
Night night.

662
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,261
Not that it's a competition...

663
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,499
but she loves me 3,000.

664
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,750
Does she, now?

665
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,036
You were somewhere in the low...

666
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:45,157
6 to 900 range.

667
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,003
Whatcha reading?

668
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,712
Just a book on composting.

669
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,925
What's new with composting?

670
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,073
Interesting science...
I figured it out.

671
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,281
By the way.

672
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,481
And, you know,

673
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,171
just so we're talking
about the same thing.

674
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,719
Time travel.

675
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:09,968
What?

676
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:17,909
That's...

677
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:20,356
amazing, and...

678
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,537
terrifying.

679
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:23,634
That's right.

680
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,949
We got really lucky.

681
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,273
Yeah.

682
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,526
I know.

683
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,139
A lot of people didn't.

684
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:38,853
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

685
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:42,019
Sorta seems like you can.

686
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,263
Not if I stop.

687
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:47,449
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

688
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:49,282
Tony...

689
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,793
trying to get you to stop...

690
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,572
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life.

691
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,662
Something tells me I should put it...

692
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:04,198
in a lockbox and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

693
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:06,793
and go to bed.

694
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:15,226
But would you be able to rest?

695
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,714
Ok. Here we go.
Time travel test number one.

696
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:25,713
Scott, fire up the...

697
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:27,939
van thing.

698
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,276
Breakers are set.

699
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,278
Emergency generators are on standby.

700
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:36,074
Good, because if we blow the grid,
I don't want to lose...

701
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:38,254
Tiny here in the 1950s.

702
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,316
Excuse me?

703
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:40,964
He's kidding.

704
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:42,904
You can't say things like that.

705
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:45,104
Just... It was a bad joke.

706
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:48,390
You were kidding, right?

707
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,479
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

708
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:53,733
Either it's all a joke or none of it is.

709
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,062
We're good!

710
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,302
Get your helmet on.

711
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,805
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week,

712
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,434
let you walk around for an hour,

713
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:02,938
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

714
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:04,423
Make sense?

715
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,186
Perfectly not confusing.

716
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,319
Good luck, Scott.

717
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:08,594
You got this.

718
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:10,715
You're right.

719
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:12,745
I do, Captain America.

720
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,404
On a count of three...

721
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:17,086
Three.

722
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:18,660
Two.

723
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:20,343
One.

724
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:25,372
Guys?

725
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:26,391
This.

726
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,937
This doesn't feel right.

727
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,666
What is this? What's going on?
Who is that?

728
00:44:29,788 --> 00:44:30,697
Hold on.
Is that Scott?

729
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:31,705
Yes, it's Scott.

730
00:44:35,278 --> 00:44:37,053
What's going on, Bruce?
My back!

731
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:38,243
What is this?
Hold on a second.

732
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,383
Could I get a little space here?

733
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

734
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:41,784
I'm working on it.

735
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:49,715
It's a baby.

736
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,523
It's Scott.
As a baby.

737
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,150
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.

738
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,913
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

739
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,321
Oh my God.

740
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,547
And...

741
00:44:57,815 --> 00:44:58,380
kill it!

742
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,091
Somebody peed my pants.

743
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:05,453
Thank God.

744
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,550
But, I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

745
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:13,920
Or just me me.

746
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:15,661
Time travel!

747
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:20,349
What?

748
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:24,431
I see this as an absolute win.

749
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,394
Why the long face?

750
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,126
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

751
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,601
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

752
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,218
It's the EPR Paradox.</b>

753
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:20,953
Instead of pushing Lang through time,
you might've wound up,

754
00:46:20,955 --> 00:46:23,440
pushing time through Lang.
It's tricky dangerous.

755
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:25,073
Somebody could have cautioned you
against it.

756
00:46:25,513 --> 00:46:26,313
You did.

757
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,568
Did I?

758
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:29,746
Well, thank God, I'm here.

759
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,165
Regardless, I fixed it.

760
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,543
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

761
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:38,715
I just want peace.

762
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,091
Turns out resentment is corrosive,
and I hate it.

763
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:44,993
Me, too.

764
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:48,330
We got a shot
at getting these stones but...

765
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,183
I got to tell you my priorities.

766
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,521
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

767
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,203
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

768
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,123
And maybe not die trying.

769
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:00,628
Would be nice.

770
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,119
Sounds like a deal.

771
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:28,888
Tony, I don't know.

772
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:29,656
Why?

773
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:31,621
He made it for you.

774
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:34,548
Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage

775
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,302
before Morgan takes it sledding.

776
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,069
Thank you, Tony.

777
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,543
Will you keep that a little quiet?

778
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:47,500
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

779
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:50,183
We are getting...

780
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:52,438
the whole team, yeah?

781
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,338
We're working on that right now.

782
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,682
Hey, Humie.

783
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:15,755
Where's Big Green?

784
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,202
The kitchen, I think.

785
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:20,716
That's awesome.

786
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,180
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

787
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:26,050
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

788
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:28,199
Oh God.

789
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,494
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

790
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:24,326
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

791
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,080
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

792
00:49:26,192 --> 00:49:27,806
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

793
00:49:27,808 --> 00:49:29,852
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

794
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,628
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

795
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,097
You should not have come.

796
00:49:35,374 --> 00:49:36,375
Valkyrie!

797
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:37,882
Great to see you,

798
00:49:38,048 --> 00:49:39,259
angry girl!

799
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,943
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

800
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:44,628
This is Rocket.
How ya doing?

801
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,323
He won't see you.

802
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,612
It's that bad?

803
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,214
We only see him once a month
when he comes in for...

804
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:54,813
supplies.

805
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:56,299
It's that bad.

806
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:57,031
Yeah.

807
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,102
What the...

808
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,315
Something died in here!

809
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:18,167
Hello?

810
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:19,593
Thor!

811
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,938
Are you here about the cable?

812
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,731
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

813
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:28,070
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy
and whatnot.

814
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:29,447
Thor?

815
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,916
Boys!
Yes.

816
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:40,558
Oh my God!

817
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,833
Oh my God, it's so good to see you!

818
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:46,494
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

819
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,343
Yeah. No I'm good. I'm good.

820
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:50,800
That's not necessary.

821
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,608
Hulk you know, ou know my friends?

822
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,613
Miek and Korg, right?

823
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:54,741
Hey, boys!
Hey, guys.

824
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,304
Long time no see.

825
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,102
Beer's in the bucket.

826
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,990
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

827
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,617
No password, obviously.

828
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,055
Thor, he's back.

829
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,806
That kid on the TV just called me
a dickhead again.

830
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:07,678
Noobmaster.

831
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,725
Yeah, NoobMaster69,

832
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:11,569
called me a dickhead.
I am sick of this.

833
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,155
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

834
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:15,422
You know, the God of Thunder.

835
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,690
Listen buddy, if you don't log off
this game immediately...

836
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:19,350
I am gonna fly over to your house,

837
00:51:19,352 --> 00:51:21,285
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

838
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,536
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

839
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,291
That's right, yes!

840
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:27,189
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

841
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:28,683
Thank you, Thor.

842
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,459
Let me know if he bothers you again,
ok?

843
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:31,727
Thank you very much. I will.

844
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,145
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

845
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:36,565
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

846
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:40,396
Buddy.

847
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,133
You alright?

848
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,644
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

849
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,028
Why, don't I look alright?

850
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,688
You look like melted ice cream.

851
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,425
So, what's up?

852
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:50,778
You just here for a hang or what?

853
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,063
We need your help.

854
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:55,446
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

855
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,861
What, like the cable?

856
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,325
Because that's been driving me
bananas for weeks.

857
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:00,415
Like Thanos.

858
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,515
Don't say that name.

859
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:26,352
Yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

860
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,067
Please take your hand off me.

861
00:52:36,078 --> 00:52:37,189
Now, I know that...

862
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:39,604
guy...

863
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:41,576
might scare you.

864
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:43,202
Why would I be...

865
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,825
Why would I be scared of that guy?

866
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,458
I'm the one who killed that guy,
remember?

867
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:51,504
Anyone else here kill that guy?

868
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:55,839
Nope.

869
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:57,861
Didn't think so.

870
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,637
Korg why don't you, tell everybody,

871
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:03,009
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

872
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:04,530
Stormbreaker?

873
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,434
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

874
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,377
I get it.

875
00:53:11,379 --> 00:53:12,555
You're in a rough spot, ok?

876
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:13,807
I've been there myself.

877
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:16,027
You wanna know
who helped me out of it?

878
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:17,324
I don't know. Is it...

879
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:18,691
Natasha?

880
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,311
It was you.

881
00:53:21,443 --> 00:53:22,560
You helped me.

882
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:25,710
So, why don't you ask...

883
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,258
the Asgardians down there...

884
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,292
how much my help is worth?

885
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,318
The ones that are left, anyway.

886
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:40,394
I think we could bring them back.

887
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,896
Stop.

888
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:44,527
Stop, ok?

889
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:47,987
I know you think I'm down here
wallowing in my own self...

890
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:49,185
pity waiting to be...

891
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:50,381
rescued and...

892
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:53,554
and saved. But I'm fine, ok.
We're fine, aren't we?

893
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:54,592
We're good here, mate.

894
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:57,116
So, whatever it is that you're offering,
we're not into it.

895
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,634
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

896
00:53:58,973 --> 00:53:59,773
Good bye.

897
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:04,188
We need you, pal.

898
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:15,916
There's beer on the ship.

899
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:21,394
What kind?

900
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,494
What I want you can't give me.

901
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:36,561
You should not be here.

902
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:40,546
Neither should you.

903
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,489
I've got a job to do.

904
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,516
Is that what you're calling this?

905
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,985
Killing all these people isn't gonna
bring your family back.

906
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:02,237
We found something.

907
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,704
A chance, maybe.

908
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,203
Don't.

909
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,482
Don't what?

910
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,094
Don't give me hope.

911
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,738
I'm sorry, I couldn't give it
to you sooner.

912
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:45,702
You're drifting left.

913
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,203
One side there, Lebowski.</b>

914
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:52,701
Ratchet, how's it going?

915
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:54,869
It's Rocket. Take it easy.

916
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,927
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

917
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,230
Time travel suit, not bad.

918
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,192
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!

919
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:07,355
I'm being very careful.

920
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:08,861
No, you're being very Hulky.

921
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:09,946
I'm being careful.

922
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:11,478
These are Pym Particles, alright?

923
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:14,251
And ever since Hank Pym got
snapped out of existence, this is it.

924
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,349
This is what we have.

925
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:16,370
We're not making any more.

926
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:18,298
Scott, calm down.
Sorry.

927
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,689
We've got enough
for one round-trip each.

928
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:21,458
That's it.

929
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,503
No do-overs.

930
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:24,554
Plus two test runs.

931
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,181
One test run.

932
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:32,094
Alright.

933
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:33,195
I'm not ready for this.

934
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:34,232
I'm game.

935
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:37,608
I'll do it.

936
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,375
Clint, now you're gonna feel

937
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:42,056
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

938
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:42,915
Don't worry about that.

939
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:44,200
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

940
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,886
If we can do this, you know...

941
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:48,265
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

942
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:49,226
You know and...

943
00:58:53,682 --> 00:58:54,962
First of all that's horrible.

944
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:55,768
It's Thanos.

945
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,063
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

946
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,552
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

947
00:59:00,554 --> 00:59:03,281
Look we go back, we get the stones
before Thanos gets them.

948
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,947
Thanos doesn't have the stones.

949
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:06,169
Problem solved.

950
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,006
Bingo.
That's not how it works.

951
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,107
Well, that's what I heard.

952
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:10,544
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

953
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,468
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

954
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,027
Time After Time.
Quantum Leap.

955
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:15,532
Wrinkle in Time.
Somewhere in Time.

956
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:16,405
Hot Tub Time Machine.

957
00:59:16,407 --> 00:59:17,374
Hot Tub Time Machine.

958
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,022
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

959
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,610
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

960
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:23,410
DieHard. No, that's not one.

961
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:24,395
This is known.

962
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,897
I don't know why everyone believes
that but that isn't true.

963
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,932
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

964
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:31,116
that past becomes your future...

965
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,459
and your former present
becomes the past...

966
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:37,486
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

967
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:38,440
Exactly.

968
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,437
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

969
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:47,448
Alright, Clint.

970
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,482
We're going in three.

971
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:50,947
Two.

972
00:59:51,682 --> 00:59:52,279
One.

973
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:05,824
Cooper?

974
01:01:06,337 --> 01:01:08,721
Where are my headphones?
Lila.

975
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,652
I never had them.
Lila?

976
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,963
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

977
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,840
Lila! Lila!

978
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,346
Yeah, Dad?

979
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:26,940
Dad?

980
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:30,541
Lila!

981
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:37,910
Hey. Hey.

982
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:39,322
Hey, look at me.

983
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:40,344
You ok?

984
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:42,039
Yeah.

985
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:43,353
Yeah.

986
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:45,767
It worked.

987
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:48,936
It worked.

988
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,174
Ok, so the how works.

989
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,777
Now, we got to figure out the when,

990
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,157
and the where.

991
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:01,041
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter,

992
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,746
with at least
one of the six Infinity Stones.

993
01:02:02,788 --> 01:02:04,496
Or substitute the word encounter,

994
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:05,601
for damn near been killed

995
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:07,082
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

996
01:02:07,151 --> 01:02:08,318
Well, I haven't...

997
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,629
but I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

998
01:02:11,082 --> 01:02:12,045
Regardless,

999
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,731
we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round-trip each.

1000
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,357
And these stones have been

1001
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,403
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1002
01:02:19,405 --> 01:02:20,355
Our history.

1003
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,727
So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in, yeah?

1004
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,794
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

1005
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:27,182
Correct.

1006
01:02:27,383 --> 01:02:28,003
So,

1007
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,317
let's start with the Aether.

1008
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:31,916
Thor, what do you know?

1009
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,533
Is he asleep?

1010
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:39,501
No, no.

1011
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:41,426
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1012
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:45,540
Where to start?

1013
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:48,757
The Aether,

1014
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:50,486
firstly is not a stone.

1015
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,686
Someone called it a stone before.

1016
01:02:54,306 --> 01:02:55,038
It's more...

1017
01:02:55,374 --> 01:02:57,740
of an angry sludge sort of a thing so...

1018
01:02:58,147 --> 01:03:00,942
someone's gonna need
to amend that and stop saying that.

1019
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,863
Here's an interesting story though...

1020
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:04,279
about the Aether.

1021
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,323
My grandfather, many years ago,

1022
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,060
had to hide the stone from...

1023
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:09,829
the Dark Elves.

1024
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,754
Scary beings. So Jane...

1025
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:14,867
actually...

1026
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:16,480
there she is.

1027
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:18,816
Yeah, so Jane was an...

1028
01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:20,548
old flame of mine.

1029
01:03:21,735 --> 01:03:24,760
You know she, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1030
01:03:25,036 --> 01:03:27,839
and, and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1031
01:03:28,234 --> 01:03:30,028
and she became very, very sick.

1032
01:03:30,065 --> 01:03:32,127
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

1033
01:03:32,202 --> 01:03:33,370
which is where I'm from,

1034
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,246
and we had to try and fix her.

1035
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,164
We were dating at the time,
you see I got...

1036
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,847
I got to introduce her to my...

1037
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,040
my mother...

1038
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:43,799
who's dead and...

1039
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,357
you know, Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

1040
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:51,359
Yes, these things happen, though.
You know?

1041
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,983
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1042
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:54,258
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.

1043
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,390
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

1044
01:03:58,601 --> 01:03:59,536
Awesome.

1045
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:01,055
Eggs? Breakfast?

1046
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:02,930
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1047
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:05,560
Quill said he stole the Power Stone
from Morag.

1048
01:04:06,163 --> 01:04:07,390
Is that a person?

1049
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,274
No, Morag's a planet.

1050
01:04:09,982 --> 01:04:11,358
Quill was a person.

1051
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,476
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

1052
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:15,865
Look.

1053
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,503
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1054
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,515
Do you wanna go to space?

1055
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,153
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1056
01:04:22,303 --> 01:04:23,636
I'll take you to space.

1057
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,780
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1058
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:28,200
What is Vormir?

1059
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,242
A dominion of death...

1060
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:33,022
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1061
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:35,978
It's where...

1062
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,273
Thanos murdered my sister.

1063
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:46,040
Not it.

1064
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:49,748
That Time Stone guy.
Doctor Strange.

1065
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,628
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

1066
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,590
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

1067
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,179
Nice place in the Village, though.

1068
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:56,588
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

1069
01:04:57,321 --> 01:04:59,236
Bleecker Street.
Wait, he lived in New York?

1070
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:01,373
Yeah, on Bleecker...
No, he lived in Toronto.

1071
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,992
And Sullivan.
Have you been listening to anything?

1072
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:03,745
Guys.

1073
01:05:04,136 --> 01:05:05,757
If you pick the right year,

1074
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,629
there are three stones in New York.

1075
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:11,533
Shut the front door.

1076
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,359
Alright. We have a plan.

1077
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:17,986
Six stones.

1078
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:19,520
Three teams.

1079
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:21,349
One shot.

1080
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,726
Five years ago, we lost.

1081
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,559
All of us.

1082
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:38,942
We lost friends.

1083
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:41,270
We lost family.

1084
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:44,900
We lost a part of ourselves.

1085
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,626
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1086
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,769
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1087
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,869
Get the stones. Get them back.

1088
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:57,800
One round-trip each.

1089
01:05:58,077 --> 01:05:59,162
No mistakes...

1090
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:00,850
no do-overs.

1091
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,294
Most of us are going somewhere
we know.

1092
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:05,713
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1093
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:07,673
Be careful.

1094
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,591
Look out for each other.

1095
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,572
This is the fight of our lives...

1096
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,964
and we're gonna win.

1097
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,475
Whatever it takes.

1098
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:22,562
Good luck.

1099
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:24,442
He's pretty good at that.

1100
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,774
Right?
Alright.

1101
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:28,215
You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

1102
01:06:29,157 --> 01:06:30,700
Trackers engaged.

1103
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,746
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1104
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:34,707
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:36,404
Ok, I'll do my best.

1106
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,912
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

1107
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,125
See ya in a minute.

1108
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,910
Alright, we all have our assignments.

1109
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:40,796
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1110
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,031
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1111
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,577
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1112
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,705
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

1113
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,920
I'd be careful going that way.

1114
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:34,548
We just had the floors waxed.

1115
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,927
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1116
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,177
You're about...

1117
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:45,958
five years too early.

1118
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,959
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1119
01:08:48,961 --> 01:08:50,463
about 20 blocks that way.

1120
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,468
What do you want from him?

1121
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:55,419
That, actually.

1122
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,469
I'm afraid not.

1123
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,312
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1124
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,254
You don't want to do this.

1125
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:05,319
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone,

1126
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,700
and I don't have time to debate it.

1127
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:17,072
Let's start over, shall we?

1128
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:29,821
For you, Lady Jane.

1129
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,794
So you have anything with pants?

1130
01:09:32,937 --> 01:09:34,063
Pants?

1131
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,256
Never mind. These will be fine.
Thank you.

1132
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,050
Yes, milady.
There is Jane.

1133
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,468
Alright.

1134
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,513
Here's the deal, tubby.

1135
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,723
You're gonna charm her,

1136
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,174
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing,

1137
01:09:46,176 --> 01:09:48,655
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1138
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:51,357
I'll be right back, ok?

1139
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:51,839
This is...

1140
01:09:52,052 --> 01:09:53,563
The wine cellar is just down here.

1141
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:56,286
My father used to have
this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1142
01:09:56,435 --> 01:09:58,095
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1143
01:09:58,097 --> 01:09:58,880
Hey. Hey!

1144
01:09:59,045 --> 01:10:00,842
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1145
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,722
If you could send Loki some soup.

1146
01:10:08,732 --> 01:10:09,390
Yes, milady.

1147
01:10:09,392 --> 01:10:10,538
And ask our librarians

1148
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,994
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1149
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,935
Who's the fancy broad?

1150
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,488
That's my mother.

1151
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:25,536
She dies today.

1152
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:28,600
That is today?

1153
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:36,380
I can't do this.

1154
01:10:36,717 --> 01:10:37,810
I can't do this.

1155
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:39,982
I should not be here.
I should not have come.

1156
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:41,042
It's a bad idea!

1157
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:42,599
Come here.
No, no, no.

1158
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,866
I think I'm having, a panic attack.

1159
01:10:45,011 --> 01:10:46,115
Come here.
I should not be here.

1160
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:46,965
Right here.
This is bad.

1161
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,951
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1162
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:51,341
What do you think we're doing here?

1163
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:53,863
I lost the only family I ever had.

1164
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:56,702
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1165
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:57,781
all gone.

1166
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,173
I get you miss your mom...

1167
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:01,675
but she's gone.

1168
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:02,843
Really gone.

1169
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,995
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1170
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,556
and you can help them.

1171
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,183
So, is it too much to ask

1172
01:11:10,185 --> 01:11:12,142
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1173
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,284
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...</b>

1174
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:15,952
and when she's not looking,

1175
01:11:16,102 --> 01:11:17,784
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1176
01:11:17,786 --> 01:11:19,547
and help me get my family back?

1177
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:21,875
Ok.

1178
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:23,405
Are you crying?

1179
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,044
No.

1180
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:28,065
Yes.

1181
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:29,750
I feel like I'm losing it.

1182
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:30,871
Get it together!

1183
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:31,946
You can do this.

1184
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,541
You can do this.

1185
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:38,399
Alright?

1186
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:39,880
Yes, I can.

1187
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:40,939
Good.

1188
01:11:43,085 --> 01:11:44,103
I can do this.

1189
01:11:44,192 --> 01:11:45,441
I can do this.

1190
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:47,529
I can't do this.

1191
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,814
Alright, heartbreaker, she's alone.

1192
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,003
This is our shot.

1193
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:52,345
Thor?

1194
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:54,050
Thor!

1195
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,077
Alright, bring it down, Blue.

1196
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,286
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1197
01:12:13,489 --> 01:12:14,790
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1198
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:16,878
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1199
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,961
All that is really helpful.

1200
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:22,672
Take care, ok?
Yeah.

1201
01:12:23,003 --> 01:12:25,119
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1202
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,511
Hey.
We got this.

1203
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,025
Let's get it done.
Yes, sir.

1204
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,028
I'll see you back.

1205
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:32,448
You guys watch each other's six.

1206
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:34,309
Yeah.

1207
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,528
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1208
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,073
All they have to do is not fall out.

1209
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,093
We're a long way from Budapest.

1210
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:02,413
Ok, so...

1211
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:07,356
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

1212
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:09,217
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1213
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,369
Let's take cover.

1214
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:15,725
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1215
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,655
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1216
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:18,976
Who else is looking for these stones?

1217
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:23,264
My father...

1218
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:25,072
my sister...

1219
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:26,717
and me.

1220
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:28,280
And you?

1221
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,253
Where are you right now?

1222
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:01,605
You're welcome.

1223
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,902
I didn't ask for your help.

1224
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,359
And yet, you always need it.

1225
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:12,735
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1226
01:14:12,737 --> 01:14:13,622
Why?

1227
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,744
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1228
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,371
Where?

1229
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:23,494
On a planet called Morag.

1230
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,172
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1231
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:29,341
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1232
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:30,607
It's a start.

1233
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,577
If he gets all of them...

1234
01:14:45,562 --> 01:14:47,442
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

1235
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:49,154
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1236
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:50,541
He won't like that.

1237
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,635
His alternative is death.

1238
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,847
Ronan's obsession...

1239
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:58,808
clouds his judgment.

1240
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,585
We will not fail you, Father.

1241
01:15:06,628 --> 01:15:07,975
No, you won't.

1242
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:11,967
I swear...

1243
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,563
I will make you proud.

1244
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:24,870
<i>We just,</i>

1245
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,240
<i>wait around for this,</i>

1246
01:15:26,242 --> 01:15:29,364
<i>Quill guy to show up and then he
leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1247
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:31,441
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1248
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:35,763
<i>We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.</i>

1249
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,052
Who was that?

1250
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:40,479
I don't know.

1251
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:42,749
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1252
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,213
Her synaptic drive was probably
damaged in battle.

1253
01:15:57,757 --> 01:15:59,395
Bring her to my ship.

1254
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:08,354
Better hustle, Cap.

1255
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,183
Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

1256
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:12,203
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

1257
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,006
If it's all the same to you...

1258
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,168
I'll have that drink now.

1259
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,099
Alright, get him on his feet.

1260
01:16:26,588 --> 01:16:28,750
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1261
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:30,940
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1262
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:33,965
Mr. Rogers,
I almost forgot that that suit,

1263
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,755
did nothing for your ass.

1264
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,447
<i>No one asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1265
01:16:37,457 --> 01:16:39,128
It's ridiculous.
<i>I think you look great, Cap.</i>

1266
01:16:39,622 --> 01:16:42,364
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1267
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,268
Who gets the, magic wand?

1268
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,972
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1269
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:58,014
We can take that off your hands.

1270
01:16:58,531 --> 01:16:59,532
By all means.

1271
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:03,557
Careful with that thing.
Yeah.

1272
01:17:03,705 --> 01:17:05,088
Unless you want your mind erased.

1273
01:17:05,212 --> 01:17:06,289
And not in a fun way.

1274
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,501
We promise to be careful.

1275
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:08,637
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1276
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:10,008
They are S.H.I.E.I.D.

1277
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:13,338
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1278
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,347
<i>Seriously? You didn't?
I mean...</i>

1279
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,262
<i>they look like bad guys.</i>

1280
01:17:17,264 --> 01:17:19,016
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1281
01:17:19,077 --> 01:17:20,951
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1282
01:17:20,953 --> 01:17:22,953
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1283
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,683
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1284
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,999
Shut up.

1285
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:29,410
Alright, you're up, little buddy.

1286
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:30,821
There's our stone.

1287
01:17:31,379 --> 01:17:32,205
Alright.

1288
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:33,649
Flick me.

1289
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:48,912
Move.
Hey.

1290
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:50,804
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1291
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:53,119
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1292
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:54,445
Take the stairs.
Yes.

1293
01:17:55,026 --> 01:17:55,820
Stop, stop.

1294
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,104
Take the stairs.

1295
01:18:00,262 --> 01:18:01,561
Hate the stairs.

1296
01:18:05,296 --> 01:18:07,851
Alright Cap,
I got our scepter in the elevator,

1297
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:09,741
just passing the 80th floor.

1298
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,413
On it.

1299
01:18:12,318 --> 01:18:13,106
Head to the lobby.

1300
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:14,293
<i>Alright, I'll see you there.</i>

1301
01:18:14,678 --> 01:18:15,789
Evidence secure.

1302
01:18:16,283 --> 01:18:17,671
We're en route to Doctor List.

1303
01:18:18,283 --> 01:18:18,893
No.

1304
01:18:19,726 --> 01:18:21,259
No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1305
01:18:26,756 --> 01:18:27,537
Captain.

1306
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,394
I thought you were coordinating
search and rescue.

1307
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:31,044
Change of plans.

1308
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:36,263
Hey, Cap.

1309
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,742
Rumlow.

1310
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,182
I just got a call from the secretary.

1311
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,225
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1312
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:52,393
Sir?

1313
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,147
I don't understand.

1314
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:58,314
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1315
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,244
Sorry, Cap.

1316
01:19:00,089 --> 01:19:01,449
We can't give you the scepter.

1317
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:03,685
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1318
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:04,984
That's ok.

1319
01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:06,196
Trust me.

1320
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,811
Hail Hydra.

1321
01:19:25,408 --> 01:19:26,998
So many stairs!

1322
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:41,837
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1323
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:42,930
It is go time.

1324
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,145
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1325
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:53,873
<i>Is. Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1326
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,334
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1327
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,577
Can we focus, please?

1328
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:58,920
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1329
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:00,630
<i>Now.</i>

1330
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,968
May I ask you where you're going?

1331
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,482
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

1332
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:11,641
Alexander Pierce.

1333
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,017
He's the man above the folks

1334
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:13,911
behind Nick Fury.

1335
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:15,525
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1336
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:18,079
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn that prisoner over to me.

1337
01:20:18,295 --> 01:20:20,145
Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1338
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,342
No, he's going to answer to us.

1339
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:22,494
Odin can have what's left.

1340
01:20:22,603 --> 01:20:23,966
And I'm gonna need that case.

1341
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,271
That's been S.H.I.E.I.D. property
for over 70 years.

1342
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,355
Hand over the case, Stark.

1343
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:28,906
Alright, move it, Stuart Little.

1344
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,191
Things are getting dicey out here.
Let's go.

1345
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,071
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1346
01:20:32,073 --> 01:20:33,626
<i>You promise me you won't die?</i>

1347
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:36,402
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1348
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,153
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1349
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,347
I need the case.

1350
01:20:39,349 --> 01:20:40,969
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1351
01:20:40,971 --> 01:20:42,182
jurisdict...
ok, then give me the case.

1352
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:42,951
Well, jurisdiction...

1353
01:20:43,183 --> 01:20:44,672
Hand it over. Hand it over.
Hand it over.

1354
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:45,675
Do it, Lang!

1355
01:20:45,677 --> 01:20:46,678
Get your hands off me.

1356
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,140
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1357
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,013
Here goes!

1358
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,007
Stark?
Stark?

1359
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:56,990
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1360
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:58,752
Medic!
Medic!

1361
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,606
Give these guys some help.

1362
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:01,904
Speak to me.

1363
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:04,235
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1364
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,323
Breathe, breathe.

1365
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,844
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1366
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,710
No stairs!

1367
01:21:31,006 --> 01:21:32,847
Come on Stark, stay with us.

1368
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,960
I'm going to try something. Ok?
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1369
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,079
Yes!

1370
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:39,316
That worked a treat.

1371
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:40,570
Dude, that was so crazy.

1372
01:21:40,572 --> 01:21:41,985
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1373
01:21:42,474 --> 01:21:43,912
The case.
The case is...

1374
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,444
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1375
01:21:47,272 --> 01:21:48,181
Loki!

1376
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,855
<i>That wasn't supposed to happen,
was it?</i>

1377
01:21:49,857 --> 01:21:50,857
We blew it.

1378
01:21:51,382 --> 01:21:52,289
Loki?

1379
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:56,079
Tony, what's going on?

1380
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,569
Tell me you found that Cube.

1381
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:03,044
You got to be shitting me.

1382
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,342
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1383
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,693
I'm not Loki...

1384
01:22:14,354 --> 01:22:15,981
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1385
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:26,163
I can do this all day.

1386
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,133
Yeah, I know.

1387
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:28,653
I know.

1388
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:02,395
Where did you get this?

1389
01:23:13,581 --> 01:23:16,625
Bucky is alive.

1390
01:23:20,188 --> 01:23:20,935
What?

1391
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,606
That is America's ass.

1392
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:43,269
Please, please.

1393
01:23:43,271 --> 01:23:45,148
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1394
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,607
If I give up the Time Stone

1395
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:49,392
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1396
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,176
With all due respect, alright...

1397
01:23:51,181 --> 01:23:54,267
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1398
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:01,448
The Infinity Stones,

1399
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:04,092
create what you experience
as the flow of time.

1400
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,209
Remove one of the stones...

1401
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,849
and that flow splits.

1402
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:10,659
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1403
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,382
but my new one, not so much.

1404
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,468
In this new branch reality,

1405
01:24:15,832 --> 01:24:18,787
without our chief weapon
against the forces of darkness,

1406
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:21,057
our world would be overrun.

1407
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,830
Millions will suffer.

1408
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,352
So tell me Doctor.

1409
01:24:24,873 --> 01:24:27,175
Can your science prevent all that?

1410
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,272
No.

1411
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:30,399
But we can erase it.

1412
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,393
Because once we're done
with the stones,

1413
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,612
we can return each one
to its own timeline,

1414
01:24:34,614 --> 01:24:36,115
at the moment it was taken.

1415
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:38,218
So, chronologically...

1416
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:41,151
in that reality...

1417
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,612
it never left.

1418
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,151
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1419
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,759
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1420
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,583
We will. I will. I promise.

1421
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:02,530
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1422
01:25:03,972 --> 01:25:04,987
It's the duty...

1423
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:06,726
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1424
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,522
to protect the Time Stone.

1425
01:25:09,086 --> 01:25:11,102
Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?

1426
01:25:12,853 --> 01:25:13,938
What did you say?

1427
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:16,617
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1428
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:18,698
Willingly?
Yes.

1429
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,343
Why?
I have no idea.

1430
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,792
Maybe he made a mistake.

1431
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:37,550
Or I did.

1432
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,239
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1433
01:26:00,644 --> 01:26:03,039
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1434
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:05,461
I fear you might be right.

1435
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:11,566
Thank you.

1436
01:26:17,757 --> 01:26:19,425
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1437
01:26:21,578 --> 01:26:22,787
We all are.

1438
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:44,580
Run diagnostics.

1439
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:47,064
Show me her memory file.

1440
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,457
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1441
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:54,585
It was a memory, but not hers.

1442
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:58,468
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1443
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,591
Another Nebula.

1444
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:03,848
Impossible.

1445
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:06,726
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1446
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,885
from nine years in the future.

1447
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,812
Where is this other Nebula?

1448
01:27:17,817 --> 01:27:20,121
In our solar system on Morag.

1449
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,655
Can you access her?

1450
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:24,570
Yes, the two are linked.

1451
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:26,932
Search the duplicate's memories,

1452
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,197
for Infinity Stones.

1453
01:27:32,976 --> 01:27:34,281
<i>And these stones have been</i>

1454
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,509
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

1455
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:37,319
<i>Our history.</i>

1456
01:27:37,654 --> 01:27:40,096
<i>So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in.</i>

1457
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:42,378
<i>Which means we have
to pick our targets.</i>

1458
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:44,011
<i>Correct.</i>
Freeze image.

1459
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,023
Terrans.

1460
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,704
Avengers.

1461
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,562
Unruly wretches.

1462
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,437
What's that reflection?

1463
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,231
Amplify this, Maw.

1464
01:28:00,672 --> 01:28:01,793
I don't understand.

1465
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:07,855
Two Nebulas.

1466
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:09,040
No.

1467
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:10,829
The same Nebula...

1468
01:28:11,697 --> 01:28:13,238
from two different times.

1469
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,058
Set course for Morag.

1470
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:18,320
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1471
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,646
I wanna see everything.

1472
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:33,261
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1473
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:35,311
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1474
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:50,352
What are you doing?

1475
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:52,711
God!

1476
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:56,165
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1477
01:28:56,167 --> 01:28:58,341
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1478
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,833
What are you wearing?

1479
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:02,014
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1480
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,676
What's wrong with your eye?

1481
01:29:07,986 --> 01:29:08,668
My eye it's...

1482
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:09,883
Remember the...

1483
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:12,588
Battle of Harokin
when I got hit in the face with the...

1484
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:14,018
broadsword?

1485
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,772
You're not the Thor I know at all,
are you?

1486
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:21,354
Yes, I am.

1487
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,277
The future hasn't been kind to you,
has it?

1488
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,513
I didn't say I was from the future.

1489
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,234
I was raised by witches, boy.

1490
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,078
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1491
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:38,415
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1492
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,209
Yes, you are, honey.

1493
01:29:40,266 --> 01:29:41,767
I really need to talk to you.

1494
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:43,176
We can talk.

1495
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:08,986
His head was over there...

1496
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:11,508
and his body over there...

1497
01:30:13,526 --> 01:30:15,601
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

1498
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,372
I was just standing there.

1499
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,083
Some idiot with an axe.

1500
01:30:21,172 --> 01:30:22,882
Now, you're no idiot.

1501
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:25,269
You're here, aren't you?

1502
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,340
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1503
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:29,717
I am. Yes.

1504
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,217
Idiot, no.

1505
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:32,779
A failure?

1506
01:30:33,162 --> 01:30:34,288
Absolutely.

1507
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:35,824
That's a little bit harsh.

1508
01:30:35,826 --> 01:30:37,327
Do you know what that makes you?

1509
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:40,373
Just like everyone else.

1510
01:30:41,045 --> 01:30:43,232
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1511
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:47,486
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1512
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:50,994
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1513
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:54,506
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1514
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,623
I've really missed you, Mom.

1515
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:09,381
Thor! I got it!

1516
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:11,569
Get that rabbit!

1517
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,467
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1518
01:31:16,469 --> 01:31:18,155
No, son, you don't.

1519
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:21,130
You're here to repair your future,
not mine.

1520
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:24,185
This is about your future.
It's none of my business.

1521
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:28,900
Hi.

1522
01:31:29,636 --> 01:31:31,267
You must be Mom.

1523
01:31:31,902 --> 01:31:33,650
I got the thing. Come on.
We got to move.

1524
01:31:33,753 --> 01:31:35,000
I wish we had more time.

1525
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,034
No, this was a gift.

1526
01:31:37,378 --> 01:31:39,831
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1527
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,181
I love you, Mom.

1528
01:31:42,183 --> 01:31:43,249
I love you.

1529
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,366
And eat a salad.

1530
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:51,757
Come on, we got to go.

1531
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:53,109
Goodbye.
Three.

1532
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:54,760
Two.
No, wait!

1533
01:31:58,189 --> 01:31:59,223
What am I looking at?

1534
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,849
Sometimes it takes a second.

1535
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:11,594
I'm still worthy.

1536
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,900
Boy.

1537
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,105
Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye.

1538
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:58,947
So, he's an idiot?

1539
01:33:00,631 --> 01:33:01,435
Yeah.

1540
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:11,684
What's that?

1541
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:13,249
The tool of a thief.

1542
01:33:23,428 --> 01:33:25,423
This is the part where spikes
come out,

1543
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:27,009
with skeletons on the end of them
and everything.

1544
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:28,228
What are you talking about?

1545
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:29,464
When you break into a place called

1546
01:33:29,466 --> 01:33:30,890
The Temple of the Power Stone,

1547
01:33:30,892 --> 01:33:32,407
there is gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1548
01:33:32,409 --> 01:33:34,045
Ok. Alright. Go ahead.
Oh my God.

1549
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,394
I wasn't always like this.

1550
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,313
Me either.

1551
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:14,673
But we work with what we got, right?

1552
01:34:18,171 --> 01:34:19,473
Let's sync up.

1553
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,795
Three, two, one.

1554
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,677
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1555
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:40,466
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1556
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,331
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1557
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:44,763
<i>Gone.</i>

1558
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:46,849
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1559
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:48,892
<i>You used them two days ago!</i>

1560
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:52,120
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

1561
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,095
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1562
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:55,876
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1563
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,277
<i>It always will be.</i>

1564
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,511
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1565
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:05,726
What did you do to them?

1566
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:07,307
Nothing.

1567
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,526
Yet.

1568
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,440
They're not trying to stop something

1569
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:14,940
I'm going to do in our time.

1570
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,754
They're trying to undo something

1571
01:35:17,756 --> 01:35:19,299
I've already done in theirs.

1572
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:20,516
The stones.

1573
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:23,336
I found them all.

1574
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:26,742
I won.

1575
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:30,673
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1576
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:36,332
This is your future.

1577
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:38,573
It's my destiny.

1578
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:41,778
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1579
01:35:42,377 --> 01:35:43,965
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1580
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:49,566
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1581
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:52,210
<i>Perhaps I treated you too harshly.</i>

1582
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,090
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1583
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:00,937
Sire...

1584
01:36:01,538 --> 01:36:02,664
your daughter...

1585
01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:06,064
No!

1586
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:07,862
Is a traitor.

1587
01:36:07,888 --> 01:36:10,349
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1588
01:36:10,421 --> 01:36:11,802
I would never betray you.

1589
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,024
Never. Never.

1590
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:20,609
I know.

1591
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:24,052
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1592
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:31,932
No!

1593
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:33,903
He knows!

1594
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,663
Barton! Barton, come in.

1595
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,287
Romanoff!

1596
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:44,552
Come in, we have a problem.

1597
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:45,705
Come on!

1598
01:36:46,082 --> 01:36:47,121
Come in, we have a...

1599
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:48,728
Thanos knows.

1600
01:36:49,763 --> 01:36:50,495
Thanos...

1601
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:05,565
Cap!

1602
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,130
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1603
01:37:10,481 --> 01:37:11,512
Yeah, we do.

1604
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:13,375
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1605
01:37:13,377 --> 01:37:14,535
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1606
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,987
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1607
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:17,791
You said that we had one shot.

1608
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,379
This was our shot.

1609
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,528
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1610
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:23,275
It was six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1611
01:37:23,467 --> 01:37:24,337
You're repeating yourself.

1612
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,789
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1613
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:26,695
Dude.
You don't know!

1614
01:37:26,697 --> 01:37:28,250
Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.

1615
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,334
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1616
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,627
I dropped the ball.
You ruined the time heist.

1617
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:31,770
Is that what I did?
Yeah.

1618
01:37:31,772 --> 01:37:33,589
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1619
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:35,453
No, no, no, there is no other options.

1620
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:36,614
There's no do-overs.

1621
01:37:36,616 --> 01:37:39,051
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1622
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:39,737
Each.

1623
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:42,306
That's it. Alright?
We use that...

1624
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:43,774
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1625
01:37:43,839 --> 01:37:45,193
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1626
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:47,584
then no one else is going home, either.

1627
01:37:47,734 --> 01:37:48,735
I got it.

1628
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:51,522
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1629
01:37:51,524 --> 01:37:53,537
and acquire new particles.

1630
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:55,899
Little stroll down memory lane.

1631
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:58,123
Military installation, Garden State.

1632
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,441
When were they both there?

1633
01:38:03,443 --> 01:38:05,985
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1634
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:07,980
How vague?
What are you talking about?

1635
01:38:07,982 --> 01:38:08,760
Where are we going?

1636
01:38:08,762 --> 01:38:10,016
I know for a fact they were there.

1637
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:10,466
Who's they?

1638
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:11,864
What are we doing?
And I know how I know.

1639
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,255
Guys what is, what is it?

1640
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,643
Looks like we're improvising.

1641
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:19,375
Great.
What are we improvising?

1642
01:38:19,377 --> 01:38:21,367
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1643
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:22,299
Suit up.

1644
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:23,488
What's in New Jersey?

1645
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:24,740
0.4 0.4

1646
01:38:24,996 --> 01:38:26,193
0.7 0.7

1647
01:38:26,253 --> 01:38:27,826
Excuse me?
1.9.7.0

1648
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:29,613
Are you sure?

1649
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:31,240
Cap? Captain?

1650
01:38:31,242 --> 01:38:33,077
Steve? Sorry.

1651
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,461
America. Rogers.

1652
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,029
Look, if you do this...

1653
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:38,771
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1654
01:38:40,082 --> 01:38:41,612
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1655
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:43,930
You trust me?

1656
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:45,877
I do.

1657
01:38:47,214 --> 01:38:48,264
Your call.

1658
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:50,664
Here we go.

1659
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:10,522
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1660
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,680
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1661
01:39:19,682 --> 01:39:20,979
The idea of me was.

1662
01:39:22,049 --> 01:39:23,636
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.I.D...

1663
01:39:23,702 --> 01:39:27,069
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1664
01:39:28,547 --> 01:39:29,639
where do you hide it?

1665
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:31,408
In plain sight.

1666
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,693
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1667
01:40:01,737 --> 01:40:03,995
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1668
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:08,712
You new here?

1669
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:12,388
Not exactly.

1670
01:40:19,306 --> 01:40:21,099
Come on, you bastard.

1671
01:40:27,898 --> 01:40:28,948
Gotcha.

1672
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,140
Back in the game.

1673
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,464
Arnim, you in there?

1674
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:54,466
Arnim?

1675
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:00,617
Hey!

1676
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:02,860
The door is this way, pal.

1677
01:41:04,787 --> 01:41:05,352
Yeah.

1678
01:41:05,751 --> 01:41:07,395
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1679
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:10,790
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1680
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:13,377
Pardon me.

1681
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:15,592
Do I know you?

1682
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:18,448
No, sir.

1683
01:41:19,908 --> 01:41:21,335
I'm a visitor from M.I.T.

1684
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:23,197
M.I.T.

1685
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:24,874
Got a name?

1686
01:41:25,549 --> 01:41:26,189
Howard.

1687
01:41:26,592 --> 01:41:28,007
That'll be easy to remember.

1688
01:41:28,313 --> 01:41:29,205
Howard?

1689
01:41:30,572 --> 01:41:31,322
Potts.

1690
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:33,375
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1691
01:41:34,214 --> 01:41:34,880
Hi.

1692
01:41:35,067 --> 01:41:36,312
Shake that, don't pull it.

1693
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:37,376
Yeah.

1694
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:41,525
You look a little green around the gills,
there, Potts.

1695
01:41:41,555 --> 01:41:43,532
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1696
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:45,154
You wanna get some air?

1697
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,525
Hello, Potts.
Yeah.

1698
01:41:50,011 --> 01:41:51,272
That'd be swell.
That way.

1699
01:41:51,328 --> 01:41:51,861
Ok.

1700
01:41:52,587 --> 01:41:53,828
Need your briefcase?

1701
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:00,636
You're not one of those beatniks,
are you, Potts?

1702
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,873
Hello?
<i>Doctor Pym?</i>

1703
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:11,359
That would be the number
that you called, yes.

1704
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:13,842
<i>This is Captain Stevens from shipping.</i>

1705
01:42:13,951 --> 01:42:15,150
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1706
01:42:15,358 --> 01:42:16,216
Bring it up.

1707
01:42:16,603 --> 01:42:18,024
<i>That's the thing sir, we can't.</i>

1708
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:22,131
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1709
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:23,383
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1710
01:42:24,097 --> 01:42:25,557
<i>Sir the box is glowing and...</i>

1711
01:42:25,712 --> 01:42:28,220
<i>to be honest some of our
mail guys aren't feeling that great.</i>

1712
01:42:28,735 --> 01:42:30,258
They didn't open it, did they?

1713
01:42:30,332 --> 01:42:32,181
<i>Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1714
01:42:33,565 --> 01:42:35,024
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1715
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,758
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1716
01:43:06,623 --> 01:43:08,098
My wife's expecting.

1717
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,936
And too much time at the office.

1718
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:14,443
Congratulations.

1719
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:16,900
Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
Yeah, sure.

1720
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:18,871
How far along is she?

1721
01:43:19,058 --> 01:43:19,820
I don't know.

1722
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:24,464
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

1723
01:43:25,027 --> 01:43:27,653
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry, again.

1724
01:43:29,162 --> 01:43:30,163
I have a little girl.

1725
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,587
A girl would be nice.

1726
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:33,850
Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1727
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:36,028
What'd be so awful about that?

1728
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:38,266
Let's just say that
the greater good has...

1729
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:39,810
rarely outweighed...

1730
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:41,718
my own self-interest.

1731
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:46,820
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1732
01:43:46,822 --> 01:43:48,908
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1733
01:43:48,932 --> 01:43:49,760
Can you describe them?

1734
01:43:49,805 --> 01:43:51,397
One of them had a hippie beard.

1735
01:43:51,405 --> 01:43:53,295
Hippie. Like Bee Gees
or Mungo Jerry?

1736
01:43:53,297 --> 01:43:54,381
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1737
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:55,395
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1738
01:43:55,397 --> 01:43:57,335
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1739
01:43:57,817 --> 01:43:59,694
We have a potential breach.

1740
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,443
I said bring them in.

1741
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:19,435
They're trying, ma'am,

1742
01:44:19,437 --> 01:44:20,802
but Braddock's unit has been
stopped by lightning strikes.

1743
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:22,191
For the love of...

1744
01:44:22,699 --> 01:44:25,255
I'll look at the weather projections.

1745
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:49,100
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1746
01:45:00,467 --> 01:45:02,200
And so, where you at with names?

1747
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:03,287
Well, if it's a boy,

1748
01:45:03,289 --> 01:45:05,130
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1749
01:45:06,575 --> 01:45:08,180
Might wanna let that stew awhile.
You got time.

1750
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:11,679
Let me ask you a question.

1751
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:14,050
When your kid was born,

1752
01:45:15,284 --> 01:45:16,309
were you nervous?

1753
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:16,973
Wildly.

1754
01:45:17,896 --> 01:45:19,606
Yeah.
Did you feel qualified?

1755
01:45:19,773 --> 01:45:20,801
Like you had any...

1756
01:45:21,269 --> 01:45:23,429
idea how to successfully
operate that thing?

1757
01:45:23,777 --> 01:45:26,694
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1758
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,782
I thought about what my dad did.

1759
01:45:29,643 --> 01:45:32,265
My old man, he never met a
problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1760
01:45:32,615 --> 01:45:34,390
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1761
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:35,997
And now, looking back on it,

1762
01:45:35,999 --> 01:45:37,152
I just remember the good stuff.

1763
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,996
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1764
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:40,581
Yeah? Like what?

1765
01:45:41,795 --> 01:45:44,030
No amount of money
ever bought a second of time.

1766
01:45:45,632 --> 01:45:46,674
Smart guy.

1767
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,316
He did his best.

1768
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:51,522
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1769
01:45:51,765 --> 01:45:53,589
and there is nothing
I would not do for him.

1770
01:46:02,216 --> 01:46:03,344
Good to meet you, Potts.

1771
01:46:04,776 --> 01:46:05,509
Yeah.

1772
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:06,636
Howard...

1773
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:09,024
everything's gonna be alright.

1774
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,145
Thank you...

1775
01:46:14,494 --> 01:46:15,653
for everything...

1776
01:46:16,246 --> 01:46:17,842
you've done for this country.

1777
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:22,414
Jarvis.

1778
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:27,285
Have we ever met that guy?

1779
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,302
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1780
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,165
Seems very familiar.

1781
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:37,520
Weird beard.

1782
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,310
You're weak.

1783
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:48,903
I'm you.

1784
01:47:06,349 --> 01:47:07,949
You could stop this.

1785
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:10,608
You know you want to.

1786
01:47:11,426 --> 01:47:13,281
Did you see what happens
in the future?

1787
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:17,265
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1788
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:20,608
You wanna know how he does that?

1789
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:23,110
You wanna know...

1790
01:47:24,138 --> 01:47:25,104
what he does...

1791
01:47:25,513 --> 01:47:26,359
to you?

1792
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:27,794
That's enough.

1793
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:41,903
You disgust me.

1794
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,117
But...

1795
01:47:44,478 --> 01:47:45,908
that doesn't mean...

1796
01:47:46,449 --> 01:47:47,728
you're useless.

1797
01:48:10,257 --> 01:48:11,252
How do I look?

1798
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:21,991
Under different circumstances...

1799
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:25,091
this would be totally awesome.

1800
01:48:37,662 --> 01:48:39,681
I bet the raccoon
didn't have to climb a mountain.

1801
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:42,642
Technically he's not a raccoon,
you know?

1802
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:44,095
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1803
01:48:44,815 --> 01:48:45,635
Welcome.

1804
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:50,078
Natasha.

1805
01:48:50,642 --> 01:48:51,718
Daughter of Ivan.

1806
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:53,674
Clint.

1807
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:55,662
Son of Edith.

1808
01:49:01,828 --> 01:49:02,877
Who are you?

1809
01:49:04,064 --> 01:49:06,049
Consider me a guide...

1810
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:07,562
to you...

1811
01:49:08,024 --> 01:49:10,403
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1812
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,322
Good.

1813
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:13,632
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1814
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:19,470
If only it were that easy.

1815
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:35,139
What you seek lies in front of you.

1816
01:49:36,946 --> 01:49:38,882
As does what you fear.

1817
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:45,704
The stone's down there.

1818
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:47,902
For one of you.

1819
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,282
For the other...

1820
01:49:53,379 --> 01:49:55,298
In order to take the stone...

1821
01:49:55,465 --> 01:49:57,909
you must lose that which you love.

1822
01:49:59,844 --> 01:50:02,220
An everlasting exchange.

1823
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:05,215
A soul...

1824
01:50:06,115 --> 01:50:07,156
for a soul.

1825
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,625
How's it going?

1826
01:50:15,485 --> 01:50:16,587
Jesus.

1827
01:50:17,236 --> 01:50:19,022
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1828
01:50:19,665 --> 01:50:20,563
No.

1829
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:22,992
I don't think so.

1830
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:25,419
Why? Because he knows
your daddy's name?

1831
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:28,414
I didn't.

1832
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:31,799
Thanos left here with the stone...

1833
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,367
without his daughter.

1834
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,389
That's not a coincidence.

1835
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,695
Yeah.

1836
01:50:41,177 --> 01:50:42,490
Whatever it takes.

1837
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:48,784
Whatever it takes.

1838
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:54,811
If we don't get that stone...

1839
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:56,982
billions of people stay dead.

1840
01:50:58,111 --> 01:50:58,716
Yeah.

1841
01:51:01,155 --> 01:51:03,056
Then I guess we both know
who it's got to be.

1842
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:05,201
I guess we do.

1843
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:14,643
I'm starting to think,

1844
01:51:15,358 --> 01:51:16,612
we mean different people here,

1845
01:51:17,023 --> 01:51:18,115
Natasha.

1846
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,832
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1847
01:51:20,842 --> 01:51:21,913
Get to right here.

1848
01:51:22,127 --> 01:51:24,345
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1849
01:51:24,347 --> 01:51:26,590
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1850
01:51:26,594 --> 01:51:28,130
What, you think I wanna do it?

1851
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:31,308
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1852
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,152
Yeah well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

1853
01:51:34,564 --> 01:51:36,412
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1854
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:39,957
You know what I've become.

1855
01:51:42,323 --> 01:51:44,706
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1856
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,286
Maybe you should.

1857
01:51:51,247 --> 01:51:52,380
You didn't.

1858
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:00,659
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1859
01:52:12,112 --> 01:52:12,728
Ok.

1860
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,262
You win.

1861
01:52:23,196 --> 01:52:24,493
Tell my family I love them.

1862
01:52:27,997 --> 01:52:28,932
You tell them yourself.

1863
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,292
Damn you.

1864
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:11,421
Wait.

1865
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,006
Let me go.

1866
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:23,583
No.

1867
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:26,550
Please, no.

1868
01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:30,986
It's ok.

1869
01:53:33,808 --> 01:53:34,809
Please.

1870
01:53:36,894 --> 01:53:37,895
No!

1871
01:55:19,372 --> 01:55:20,373
Did we get them all?

1872
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,584
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1873
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:29,484
Clint, where's Nat?

1874
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:00,130
Do we know if she had family?

1875
01:56:01,038 --> 01:56:01,847
Yeah.

1876
01:56:02,373 --> 01:56:03,374
Us.

1877
01:56:04,792 --> 01:56:05,835
What?

1878
01:56:07,795 --> 01:56:09,120
What are you doing?
Just asked him a question.

1879
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:10,538
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1880
01:56:10,548 --> 01:56:11,747
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1881
01:56:11,757 --> 01:56:13,008
We have the stones, right?

1882
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,333
As long as we have the stones.

1883
01:56:14,343 --> 01:56:16,148
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1884
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:18,348
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1885
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,397
Can't get her back.

1886
01:56:22,729 --> 01:56:23,980
What's he... What?

1887
01:56:23,982 --> 01:56:25,192
It can't be undone.

1888
01:56:25,855 --> 01:56:26,762
It can't.

1889
01:56:29,661 --> 01:56:31,053
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

1890
01:56:31,055 --> 01:56:32,873
but you're a very earthly being.

1891
01:56:33,068 --> 01:56:34,711
Ok, and we're talking
about space magic.

1892
01:56:34,851 --> 01:56:36,890
And can't seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1893
01:56:36,892 --> 01:56:38,588
Yeah, look, I know that
I'm way outside my...

1894
01:56:38,713 --> 01:56:39,671
my pay grade here.

1895
01:56:39,861 --> 01:56:41,374
But she still isn't here, is she?

1896
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,621
No, that's my point.

1897
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:43,521
It can't...

1898
01:56:44,197 --> 01:56:45,145
be undone.

1899
01:56:45,776 --> 01:56:49,171
Or that's at least what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1900
01:56:49,271 --> 01:56:50,880
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, ok?

1901
01:56:51,046 --> 01:56:52,212
Go grab your hammer,

1902
01:56:52,214 --> 01:56:54,092
and you go fly and you talk to him.

1903
01:57:02,383 --> 01:57:03,512
It was supposed to be me.

1904
01:57:06,937 --> 01:57:09,288
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1905
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:10,659
She bet her life on it.

1906
01:57:15,732 --> 01:57:16,872
She's not coming back.

1907
01:57:19,909 --> 01:57:21,368
We have to make it worth it.

1908
01:57:21,842 --> 01:57:22,781
We have to.

1909
01:57:24,767 --> 01:57:25,673
We will.

1910
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:51,741
Boom!

1911
01:57:57,863 --> 01:57:59,323
Alright, the glove's ready.

1912
01:58:00,241 --> 01:58:02,516
Question is, who's gonna snap
their freaking fingers?

1913
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:05,079
I'll do it.
Excuse me?

1914
01:58:05,204 --> 01:58:05,860
It's ok.

1915
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:07,331
Hey. Stop, stop.
Slow down.

1916
01:58:07,531 --> 01:58:08,512
Thor. Just wait.

1917
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:10,338
You know we haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1918
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:14,245
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1919
01:58:14,334 --> 01:58:15,500
We should at least discuss it.

1920
01:58:15,633 --> 01:58:17,612
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

1921
01:58:17,614 --> 01:58:19,185
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1922
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:21,888
I'm the strongest Avenger, ok?

1923
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:23,683
So this responsibility falls upon me.

1924
01:58:23,685 --> 01:58:24,895
It's my duty.
Normally, you're right.

1925
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,827
It's not about that.
It's not that.

1926
01:58:27,062 --> 01:58:28,402
Stop it! Just let me.

1927
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:32,931
Just let me do it.

1928
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,638
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1929
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,601
Look, it's not just the fact
that that glove

1930
01:58:37,603 --> 01:58:39,531
is channeling enough energy
to light up a continent.

1931
01:58:39,572 --> 01:58:41,633
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1932
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,785
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1933
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:45,989
Cheez. Whiz.

1934
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:49,540
Lightning.

1935
01:58:49,573 --> 01:58:50,699
Yeah.
Lightning.

1936
01:58:50,851 --> 01:58:52,227
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1937
01:58:52,543 --> 01:58:53,953
It's got to be me.

1938
01:58:55,713 --> 01:58:57,749
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

1939
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,359
They almost killed him.

1940
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:02,886
None of you could survive.

1941
01:59:03,596 --> 01:59:04,904
How do we know you will?

1942
01:59:05,389 --> 01:59:06,432
We don't.

1943
01:59:06,724 --> 01:59:08,788
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1944
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:13,863
It's like...

1945
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:17,744
I was made for this.

1946
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:38,301
Good to go, yeah?

1947
01:59:40,716 --> 01:59:41,717
Let's do it.

1948
01:59:41,884 --> 01:59:43,150
Ok, remember,

1949
01:59:43,171 --> 01:59:45,128
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago.

1950
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:46,993
You're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1951
01:59:47,723 --> 01:59:49,449
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1952
01:59:50,559 --> 01:59:51,440
Got it.

1953
02:00:08,368 --> 02:00:09,370
Friday, do me a favor

1954
02:00:09,372 --> 02:00:11,080
and activate Barn Door Protocol,
will ya?

1955
02:00:11,082 --> 02:00:11,942
Yes, boss.

1956
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:22,352
Everybody comes home.

1957
02:00:46,198 --> 02:00:47,730
Take it off! Take it off!

1958
02:00:47,732 --> 02:00:49,037
No, wait. Bruce, are you ok?

1959
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Talk to me, Banner.

1960
02:00:54,456 --> 02:00:55,457
I'm ok.

1961
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:56,985
I'm ok.

1962
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:29,825
Bruce!

1963
02:01:31,577 --> 02:01:32,387
Don't move him.

1964
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:42,408
Did it work?
We're not sure. It's ok.

1965
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,426
Honey.

1966
02:02:29,593 --> 02:02:30,552
Clint?

1967
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:31,702
Honey.

1968
02:02:32,672 --> 02:02:33,797
Guys...

1969
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,976
I think it worked.

1970
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:22,479
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1971
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:25,524
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1972
02:03:32,155 --> 02:03:33,949
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1973
02:03:35,117 --> 02:03:36,660
Let me up! Let me up!

1974
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:38,211
Come on!

1975
02:03:48,297 --> 02:03:49,131
Rhodey!

1976
02:03:57,681 --> 02:03:59,391
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

1977
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:01,001
<i>We 're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

1978
02:04:01,003 --> 02:04:02,382
What? What?

1979
02:04:02,573 --> 02:04:04,742
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1980
02:04:05,105 --> 02:04:07,024
Wait! I'm here!

1981
02:04:07,441 --> 02:04:08,942
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1982
02:04:28,587 --> 02:04:29,796
Cap?

1983
02:04:53,779 --> 02:04:54,905
Ok.

1984
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:15,300
Daughter.

1985
02:05:15,467 --> 02:05:16,635
Yes, Father.

1986
02:05:18,512 --> 02:05:20,222
So, this is the future.

1987
02:05:20,889 --> 02:05:21,829
Well done.

1988
02:05:22,641 --> 02:05:23,845
Thank you, Father.

1989
02:05:24,434 --> 02:05:25,811
They suspected nothing.

1990
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:29,481
The arrogant never do.

1991
02:05:32,442 --> 02:05:33,568
Go.

1992
02:05:34,528 --> 02:05:36,947
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1993
02:05:37,114 --> 02:05:38,247
What will you do?

1994
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:41,181
Wait.

1995
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:08,361
Tell me something.

1996
02:06:09,855 --> 02:06:11,039
In the future...

1997
02:06:12,814 --> 02:06:14,086
what happens to you and me?

1998
02:06:16,611 --> 02:06:17,887
I try to kill you.

1999
02:06:19,948 --> 02:06:21,238
Several times.

2000
02:06:22,534 --> 02:06:23,853
But eventually...

2001
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:25,920
we become friends.

2002
02:06:28,123 --> 02:06:29,513
We become sisters.

2003
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:38,717
Come on.

2004
02:06:40,761 --> 02:06:41,938
We can stop him.

2005
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:51,743
Come on, buddy, wake up!

2006
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:53,607
That's my man.

2007
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:56,073
You lose this again,

2008
02:06:56,387 --> 02:06:57,366
I'm keeping it.

2009
02:07:00,489 --> 02:07:01,509
What happened?

2010
02:07:01,823 --> 02:07:03,728
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

2011
02:07:03,944 --> 02:07:04,820
You'll see.

2012
02:07:27,099 --> 02:07:28,304
What's he been doing?

2013
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:31,629
Absolutely nothing.

2014
02:07:33,563 --> 02:07:34,708
Where are the stones?

2015
02:07:35,816 --> 02:07:37,116
Somewhere under all this.

2016
02:07:39,027 --> 02:07:40,538
All I know is he doesn't have them.

2017
02:07:41,404 --> 02:07:42,855
So, we keep it that way.

2018
02:07:43,135 --> 02:07:44,422
You know it's a trap, right?

2019
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:45,756
Yeah.

2020
02:07:46,368 --> 02:07:47,405
I don't much care.

2021
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:49,278
Good.

2022
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:52,619
Just as long as
we're all in agreement.

2023
02:08:02,676 --> 02:08:04,495
Let's kill him properly this time.

2024
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:16,526
You could not live
with your own failure.

2025
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:20,122
Where did that bring you?

2026
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,583
Back to me.

2027
02:08:28,756 --> 02:08:30,976
I thought by eliminating half of life...

2028
02:08:32,164 --> 02:08:33,667
the other half would thrive.

2029
02:08:34,793 --> 02:08:36,127
But you've shown me...

2030
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,785
that's impossible.

2031
02:08:40,881 --> 02:08:43,824
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2032
02:08:44,342 --> 02:08:47,256
there will always be those
that are unable,

2033
02:08:47,385 --> 02:08:49,283
to accept what can be.

2034
02:08:50,307 --> 02:08:51,558
They will resist.

2035
02:08:52,058 --> 02:08:53,764
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

2036
02:08:54,895 --> 02:08:56,052
I'm thankful.

2037
02:08:58,648 --> 02:08:59,860
Because now...

2038
02:09:00,567 --> 02:09:02,247
I know what I must do.

2039
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:04,265
I will,

2040
02:09:04,664 --> 02:09:08,218
shred this universe
down to its last atom.

2041
02:09:09,117 --> 02:09:10,366
And then...

2042
02:09:11,006 --> 02:09:13,342
with the stones
you've collected for me,

2043
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,443
create a new one,

2044
02:09:16,537 --> 02:09:18,066
teeming with life,

2045
02:09:18,752 --> 02:09:20,629
that knows not what it has lost,

2046
02:09:20,717 --> 02:09:22,792
but only what it has been given.

2047
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:27,760
A grateful universe.

2048
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:29,498
Born out of blood.

2049
02:09:29,804 --> 02:09:31,161
They'll never know it.

2050
02:09:32,572 --> 02:09:35,099
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2051
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,548
See you on the other side, man.

2052
02:09:53,828 --> 02:09:55,830
Hang on! I'm coming!

2053
02:10:26,111 --> 02:10:27,112
Yeah!

2054
02:10:42,002 --> 02:10:42,743
Hey.

2055
02:10:43,712 --> 02:10:44,663
I know you.

2056
02:10:48,294 --> 02:10:49,295
Father.

2057
02:10:50,093 --> 02:10:51,319
I have the stones.

2058
02:10:51,678 --> 02:10:52,406
What?

2059
02:10:53,972 --> 02:10:54,889
Stop.

2060
02:11:00,103 --> 02:11:01,521
You're betraying us?

2061
02:11:07,527 --> 02:11:08,820
You don't have to do this.

2062
02:11:11,656 --> 02:11:12,438
I am...

2063
02:11:13,544 --> 02:11:14,222
This.

2064
02:11:14,326 --> 02:11:16,244
No, you're not.

2065
02:11:16,703 --> 02:11:18,432
You've seen what we become.

2066
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:26,520
Nebula, listen to her.

2067
02:11:28,542 --> 02:11:29,575
You can change.

2068
02:11:35,889 --> 02:11:37,250
He won't let me.

2069
02:11:39,017 --> 02:11:39,817
No!

2070
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:00,789
Ok, Thor. Hit me.

2071
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,560
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

2072
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:11,317
I knew it!

2073
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:36,237
In all my years of conquest...

2074
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:38,876
violence...

2075
02:14:40,615 --> 02:14:41,985
slaughter...

2076
02:14:43,701 --> 02:14:45,235
it was never personal.

2077
02:14:49,051 --> 02:14:50,169
But I'll tell you now...

2078
02:14:52,794 --> 02:14:55,547
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2079
02:14:56,524 --> 02:14:58,355
annoying little planet...

2080
02:15:00,802 --> 02:15:02,344
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2081
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:05,348
very, very much.

2082
02:16:09,787 --> 02:16:11,331
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

2083
02:16:17,337 --> 02:16:19,077
<i>Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?</i>

2084
02:16:23,682 --> 02:16:24,865
<i>On your left.</i>

2085
02:17:50,659 --> 02:17:51,839
Is that everyone?

2086
02:17:52,181 --> 02:17:53,775
What? You wanted more?

2087
02:18:21,155 --> 02:18:22,145
Avengers!

2088
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:28,708
Assemble.

2089
02:19:04,295 --> 02:19:05,546
Die!

2090
02:19:26,192 --> 02:19:27,091
No, no, give me that.

2091
02:19:27,502 --> 02:19:28,600
You have the little one.

2092
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:43,459
Hey!

2093
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:45,461
Holy cow!

2094
02:19:45,628 --> 02:19:47,078
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2095
02:19:47,088 --> 02:19:48,581
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2096
02:19:48,695 --> 02:19:49,885
And I got all dusty?

2097
02:19:50,007 --> 02:19:51,094
And I must've passed out,

2098
02:19:51,096 --> 02:19:52,472
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2099
02:19:52,577 --> 02:19:54,627
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

2100
02:19:54,637 --> 02:19:56,137
It's been five years.
Come on, they need us.

2101
02:19:56,305 --> 02:19:57,964
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing,

2102
02:19:57,974 --> 02:19:59,079
that he does all the time.
He did? No.

2103
02:19:59,081 --> 02:19:59,843
What are you doing?

2104
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:06,352
This is nice.

2105
02:20:28,956 --> 02:20:29,864
Gamora?

2106
02:20:39,181 --> 02:20:40,587
I thought I lost you.

2107
02:20:45,438 --> 02:20:47,892
Don't... touch... me!

2108
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:52,752
You missed the first time.

2109
02:20:53,362 --> 02:20:55,364
Then you got them both
the second time.

2110
02:20:57,366 --> 02:20:58,451
This is the one?

2111
02:20:58,618 --> 02:20:59,619
Seriously?

2112
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:02,022
Your choices were him or a tree.

2113
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:13,168
Cap!

2114
02:21:13,758 --> 02:21:15,626
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2115
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:20,264
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2116
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:21,474
No!

2117
02:21:22,642 --> 02:21:24,602
We need to get them back
where they came from.

2118
02:21:24,769 --> 02:21:25,695
No way to get them back.

2119
02:21:25,697 --> 02:21:27,031
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2120
02:21:27,521 --> 02:21:28,356
Hold on!

2121
02:21:30,232 --> 02:21:32,016
That wasn't our only time machine.

2122
02:21:38,366 --> 02:21:40,190
Anyone see
an ugly brown van out there?

2123
02:21:40,826 --> 02:21:43,620
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2124
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:46,254
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2125
02:21:47,416 --> 02:21:48,584
Maybe 10 minutes.

2126
02:21:48,751 --> 02:21:50,305
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2127
02:21:50,482 --> 02:21:51,446
We're on it, Cap.

2128
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:02,454
Hey.

2129
02:22:03,015 --> 02:22:05,171
You said one out of 14 million,
we win, yeah?

2130
02:22:06,936 --> 02:22:07,937
Tell me this is it.

2131
02:22:08,354 --> 02:22:10,052
If I tell you what happens...

2132
02:22:10,593 --> 02:22:11,680
it won't happen.

2133
02:22:15,425 --> 02:22:16,426
You better be right.

2134
02:22:24,578 --> 02:22:25,955
It's a mess back here.

2135
02:22:27,256 --> 02:22:28,557
It's dead.

2136
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:30,333
What?
It's dead.

2137
02:22:30,918 --> 02:22:32,230
I have to hot-wire it.

2138
02:22:35,423 --> 02:22:36,461
Where's Nebula?

2139
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:38,975
She's not responding.

2140
02:22:39,468 --> 02:22:40,466
Sire.

2141
02:22:50,563 --> 02:22:51,264
Clint!

2142
02:22:53,858 --> 02:22:54,802
Give it to me.

2143
02:23:17,256 --> 02:23:20,424
You took everything from me.

2144
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:23,011
I don't even know who you are.

2145
02:23:23,512 --> 02:23:24,442
You will.

2146
02:23:47,578 --> 02:23:48,537
I got it!

2147
02:23:51,082 --> 02:23:52,166
Activate Instant Kill.

2148
02:24:15,606 --> 02:24:16,941
Rain fire!

2149
02:24:17,650 --> 02:24:19,568
But, sire, our troops!

2150
02:24:19,735 --> 02:24:21,214
Just do it!

2151
02:24:42,438 --> 02:24:43,743
Is anyone else seeing this?

2152
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:59,066
I got this!

2153
02:24:59,316 --> 02:25:01,110
I got this. Ok, I don't got this.

2154
02:25:01,443 --> 02:25:02,611
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

2155
02:25:02,778 --> 02:25:04,462
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2156
02:25:14,707 --> 02:25:15,751
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2157
02:25:19,378 --> 02:25:20,590
Hey! Nice to meet you.

2158
02:25:21,035 --> 02:25:22,151
Oh my God!

2159
02:25:58,792 --> 02:26:00,252
What the hell is this?

2160
02:26:01,045 --> 02:26:02,224
Friday, what are they firing at?

2161
02:26:02,232 --> 02:26:04,037
<i>Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.</i>

2162
02:26:18,384 --> 02:26:19,165
Yeah!

2163
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,562
Danvers,

2164
02:26:40,872 --> 02:26:42,084
we need an assist here.

2165
02:26:50,678 --> 02:26:51,694
Hi, I'm...

2166
02:26:52,264 --> 02:26:53,265
Peter Parker.

2167
02:26:53,889 --> 02:26:55,066
Hey, Peter Parker.

2168
02:26:55,528 --> 02:26:56,546
You got something for me?

2169
02:27:02,773 --> 02:27:05,208
I don't know how you're gonna get it
through all of that.

2170
02:27:06,527 --> 02:27:07,945
Don't worry.

2171
02:27:08,821 --> 02:27:10,406
She's got help.

2172
02:29:58,198 --> 02:29:59,136
I am...

2173
02:29:59,888 --> 02:30:01,050
inevitable.

2174
02:30:21,847 --> 02:30:22,892
And I...

2175
02:30:25,058 --> 02:30:25,999
am...

2176
02:30:29,938 --> 02:30:31,250
Iron Man.

2177
02:32:30,142 --> 02:32:31,287
Mr. Stark?

2178
02:32:32,269 --> 02:32:33,138
Hey!

2179
02:32:34,529 --> 02:32:35,469
Mr. Stark.

2180
02:32:35,789 --> 02:32:36,872
Can you hear me?

2181
02:32:37,649 --> 02:32:38,702
It's Peter.

2182
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:41,361
Hey.

2183
02:32:43,155 --> 02:32:44,087
We won,

2184
02:32:44,581 --> 02:32:45,695
Mr. Stark.

2185
02:32:48,035 --> 02:32:49,431
We won, Mr. Stark.

2186
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:53,572
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

2187
02:32:55,125 --> 02:32:56,877
I'm sorry.

2188
02:32:57,044 --> 02:32:58,045
Tony.

2189
02:33:11,725 --> 02:33:12,577
Hey.

2190
02:33:12,934 --> 02:33:13,919
Hey, Pep.

2191
02:33:19,066 --> 02:33:19,999
Friday?

2192
02:33:20,317 --> 02:33:21,992
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2193
02:33:31,662 --> 02:33:32,663
Tony?

2194
02:33:33,914 --> 02:33:34,935
Look at me.

2195
02:33:37,668 --> 02:33:38,862
We're gonna be ok.

2196
02:33:44,299 --> 02:33:45,731
You can rest now.

2197
02:35:31,698 --> 02:35:34,034
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i></font>

2198
02:35:34,659 --> 02:35:36,284
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But it doesn't always roll that way.</i></font>

2199
02:35:38,955 --> 02:35:40,133
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Maybe this time.</i></font>

2200
02:35:42,209 --> 02:35:44,527
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm hoping if you play this back,</i></font>

2201
02:35:46,546 --> 02:35:47,881

2202
02:35:49,132 --> 02:35:52,967

2203

2205
02:35:59,601 --> 02:36:00,822
<font color="#00ffff"><i>God, what a world.</i></font>

2206
02:36:01,277 --> 02:36:02,605
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Universe, now.</i></font>

2207
02:36:03,563 --> 02:36:05,690
<font color="#00ffff"><i>If you told me 10 years ago

2208
02:36:05,692 --> 02:36:07,625
<font color="#00ffff"><i>let alone to this extent, I mean.</i></font>

2209
02:36:07,771 --> 02:36:10,765
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I would not have been

2222

<font color="#00ffff"><i>That's the thing.</i></font>

2223
02:36:44,688 --> 02:36:46,043
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Then again, that's the hero gig.</i></font>

2229
02:39:15,213 --> 02:39:16,797
You know, I wish there was a way...

2230
02:39:17,647 --> 02:39:18,857
that I could let her know.

2231
02:39:21,469 --> 02:39:22,585
That we won.

2232
02:39:24,973 --> 02:39:25,773
We did it.

2233
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:31,304
She knows.

2234
02:39:36,943 --> 02:39:38,200
They both do.

2235
02:39:47,996 --> 02:39:49,180
How you doing, squirt?

2236
02:39:49,505 --> 02:39:50,248
Good.

2237
02:39:50,337 --> 02:39:51,096
You good?

2238
02:39:51,988 --> 02:39:53,321
Ok. You hungry?

2239
02:39:55,045 --> 02:39:56,046
What do you want?

2240
02:39:56,755 --> 02:39:57,835
Cheeseburgers.

2241
02:40:02,969 --> 02:40:04,658
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2242
02:40:05,388 --> 02:40:06,230
Ok.

2243
02:40:09,392 --> 02:40:11,169
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

2244
02:40:11,811 --> 02:40:12,487
Ok.

2245
02:40:29,579 --> 02:40:30,398
So...

2246
02:40:31,247 --> 02:40:32,861
when can we expect you back?

2247
02:40:35,642 --> 02:40:36,644
About that...

2248
02:40:37,210 --> 02:40:39,578
Thor, your people need a king.

2249
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:41,191
No, they already have one.

2250
02:40:43,746 --> 02:40:44,747
That's funny.

2251
02:40:50,016 --> 02:40:51,337
Are you being serious?

2252
02:40:55,522 --> 02:40:57,427
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than...

2253
02:40:58,467 --> 02:40:59,924
who I'm supposed to be.

2254
02:41:02,237 --> 02:41:03,988
But you, you're a leader.

2255
02:41:04,614 --> 02:41:05,732
That's who you are.

2256
02:41:08,736 --> 02:41:10,596
You know, I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

2257
02:41:10,954 --> 02:41:12,074
I'm counting on it...

2258
02:41:12,622 --> 02:41:13,683
Your Majesty.

2259
02:41:24,259 --> 02:41:25,468
What will you do?

2260
02:41:26,133 --> 02:41:27,229
I'm not sure.

2261
02:41:28,047 --> 02:41:29,801
For the first time
in a thousand years, I...

2262
02:41:30,419 --> 02:41:31,514
I have no path.

2263
02:41:31,516 --> 02:41:32,792
I do have a ride though.

2264
02:41:33,101 --> 02:41:34,817
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2265
02:41:39,566 --> 02:41:40,717
Well, here we are.

2266
02:41:41,568 --> 02:41:43,111
Tree, good to see you.

2267
02:41:47,761 --> 02:41:50,379
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2268
02:41:51,411 --> 02:41:52,912
Where to first?

2269
02:41:54,414 --> 02:41:55,456
Hey.

2270
02:41:56,167 --> 02:41:58,127
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2271
02:41:58,365 --> 02:41:59,366
I'm in charge.

2272
02:41:59,627 --> 02:42:02,104
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2273
02:42:02,463 --> 02:42:03,464
Of course.

2274
02:42:06,634 --> 02:42:08,823
See, you say, of course,
but then you touch the map.

2275
02:42:09,345 --> 02:42:10,606
It makes you think that maybe

2276
02:42:10,616 --> 02:42:12,138
you didn't realize I was in charge.

2277
02:42:12,473 --> 02:42:13,906
Quail, that's your own

2278
02:42:13,907 --> 02:42:15,142
insecurities in there.
Quail?

2279
02:42:15,143 --> 02:42:17,535
Ok? I am merely trying
to be of service and assisting.

2280
02:42:17,562 --> 02:42:18,291
Quill.

2281
02:42:18,938 --> 02:42:19,814
That's what I said.

2282
02:42:19,981 --> 02:42:22,416
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2283
02:42:22,525 --> 02:42:23,585
Sounds fair.

2284
02:42:26,654 --> 02:42:28,021
It's not necessary.
It's not.

2285
02:42:28,738 --> 02:42:30,029
Ok?
I got some blasters,

2286
02:42:30,031 --> 02:42:31,466
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2287
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:34,032
Yes! Please, use knives.

2288
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:35,205
Yeah. Knives.

2289
02:42:35,207 --> 02:42:36,410
I am Groot.

2290
02:42:42,747 --> 02:42:44,124
Not necessary.

2291
02:42:44,127 --> 02:42:45,875
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2292
02:42:45,877 --> 02:42:48,272
Everybody knows, who's in charge.

2293
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:53,067
Me.

2294
02:42:54,724 --> 02:42:55,558
Right?

2295
02:42:56,476 --> 02:42:58,396
Yes, you.

2296
02:42:58,937 --> 02:43:01,178
Of course! Of course.

2297
02:43:01,522 --> 02:43:02,476
Of course.

2298
02:43:04,943 --> 02:43:05,979
Remember...

2299
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:08,611
you have to return the stones

2300
02:43:08,613 --> 02:43:09,771
to the exact moment you got them

2301
02:43:09,781 --> 02:43:10,722
or you're gonna open up

2302
02:43:10,724 --> 02:43:12,462
a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2303
02:43:13,159 --> 02:43:14,160
Don't worry, Bruce.

2304
02:43:14,702 --> 02:43:15,774
Clip all the branches.

2305
02:43:17,121 --> 02:43:18,334
You know, I tried.

2306
02:43:20,166 --> 02:43:21,968
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,

2307
02:43:21,970 --> 02:43:23,691
I really tried to bring her back.

2308
02:43:27,674 --> 02:43:28,934
I miss her, man.

2309
02:43:29,832 --> 02:43:30,688
Me too.

2310
02:43:34,764 --> 02:43:37,183
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2311
02:43:39,769 --> 02:43:40,996
You're a good man, Sam.

2312
02:43:41,709 --> 02:43:43,252
This one's on me, though.

2313
02:43:47,777 --> 02:43:49,696
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2314
02:43:51,531 --> 02:43:52,486
How can I?

2315
02:43:52,949 --> 02:43:54,571
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2316
02:44:02,333 --> 02:44:03,737
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2317
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,624
It's gonna be ok, Buck.

2318
02:44:13,386 --> 02:44:14,919
How long is this gonna take?

2319
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:17,968
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2320
02:44:23,271 --> 02:44:24,522
You ready, Cap?

2321
02:44:24,689 --> 02:44:27,108
Alright, we'll meet you back here, ok?

2322
02:44:27,775 --> 02:44:28,901
You bet.

2323
02:44:30,403 --> 02:44:31,988
Going quantum. Three.

2324
02:44:32,572 --> 02:44:33,406
Two.

2325
02:44:34,073 --> 02:44:34,839
One.

2326
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:38,942
And returning in five.

2327
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:40,077
Four.

2328
02:44:40,496 --> 02:44:41,237
Three.

2329
02:44:41,652 --> 02:44:42,287
Two.

2330
02:44:42,732 --> 02:44:43,330
One.

2331
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:52,091
Where is he?

2332
02:44:52,258 --> 02:44:54,215
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

2333
02:44:54,225 --> 02:44:55,230
He should be here.

2334
02:45:01,243 --> 02:45:02,161
Get him back.

2335
02:45:02,226 --> 02:45:03,693
I'm trying.
Get him the hell back.

2336
02:45:03,695 --> 02:45:04,727
Hey, I said I'm trying.

2337
02:45:04,728 --> 02:45:05,725
Sam.

2338
02:45:29,238 --> 02:45:30,366
Go ahead.

2339
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:49,740
Cap?

2340
02:45:52,026 --> 02:45:52,974
Hi, Sam.

2341
02:45:56,781 --> 02:45:59,623
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2342
02:46:01,953 --> 02:46:03,011
Well, after I...

2343
02:46:03,422 --> 02:46:05,291
put the stones back, I thought...

2344
02:46:06,916 --> 02:46:07,823
maybe...

2345
02:46:08,751 --> 02:46:10,592
I'll try some of that life Tony was...

2346
02:46:11,672 --> 02:46:12,930
telling me to get.

2347
02:46:15,550 --> 02:46:17,238
How'd that work out for ya?

2348
02:46:20,179 --> 02:46:21,350
It was beautiful.

2349
02:46:22,932 --> 02:46:24,376
Good. I'm happy for you.

2350
02:46:24,809 --> 02:46:25,687
Truly.

2351
02:46:26,602 --> 02:46:27,589
Thank you.

2352
02:46:29,230 --> 02:46:30,646
Only thing bumming me out

2353
02:46:30,648 --> 02:46:32,257
is the fact I have to live in a world

2354
02:46:32,259 --> 02:46:33,779
without Captain America.

2355
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:39,493
That reminds me.

2356
02:46:49,333 --> 02:46:50,294
Try it on.

2357
02:47:16,068 --> 02:47:17,299
How does it feel?

2358
02:47:20,156 --> 02:47:21,729
Like it's someone else's.

2359
02:47:24,911 --> 02:47:26,078
It isn't.

2360
02:47:39,425 --> 02:47:40,379
Thank you.

2361
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,013
I'll do my best.

2362
02:47:49,393 --> 02:47:51,021
That's why it's yours.

2363
02:47:53,022 --> 02:47:54,456
You wanna tell me about her?

2364
02:48:00,988 --> 02:48:01,986
No.

2365
02:48:02,907 --> 02:48:04,479
No, I don't think I will.

2366
02:49:04,078 --> 02:49:07,098
