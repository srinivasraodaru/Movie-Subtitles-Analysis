1
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,036
<i>They say,
if you wanna tell a story right,</i>

2
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,829
<i>you gotta start at the beginning.</i>

3
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,252
<i>Too far? Fine.</i>

4
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,089
<i>This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</i>

5
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,175
<i>When I was a kid, my dad traded me
for a six-pack of beer.</i>

6
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,736
<i>But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</i>

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,928
Daddy!

8
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,596
<i>- ...I kept coming back.</i>
- Ah!

9
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,015
<i>Eventually, he found me a new home.</i>

10
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,159
<i>The good sisters</i>

11
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,686
<i>of St. Bernadette's
taught me a lot.</i>

12
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,898
<i>But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</i>

13
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,818
<i>All things considered, I did good.</i>

14
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,236
<i>I even went to college.</i>

15
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:09,946
<i>Got my PhD.</i>

16
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:11,990
<i>Had my heart broken
once or twice.</i>

17
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>Finding love, it's not easy.</i>

18
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,536
<i>So I threw myself into my work,</i>

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,870
<i>became a psychiatrist.</i>

20
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,123
<i>That's when I met him.</i>

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,959
<i>Mr. J. My Joker.</i>

22
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,502
<i>Oh, I fell hard.</i>

23
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,171
<i>Like out of a plane without a parachute,</i>

24
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,440
<i>right in your dumb fucking face</i>

25
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,549
<i>kinda hard.</i>

26
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,135
<i>I lost all sense of who I was.</i>

27
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,846
<i>I only had eyes for Puddin'.</i>

28
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,472
<i>We all know the saying,</i>

29
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,141
<i>"Behind every successful man,</i>

30
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,684
<i>there's a badass broad."</i>

31
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,561
<i>Well, that was me.</i>

32
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:43,563
<i>I was the brains
behind some of</i>

33
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,231
<i>- Mr. J's greatest stunts.</i>
- Ha-ha!

34
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:46,816
<i>Not that he let anyone know it.</i>

35
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,002
Puddin'?

36
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,987
<i>I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</i>

37
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,615
<i>So...</i>

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,410
<i>...we broke up.</i>

39
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,914
<i>I handled it real mature.</i>

40
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,084
<i>But Mr. J was super broke up about it.</i>

41
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:13,134
<i>I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</i>

42
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:20,224
<i>It gave me the space to really reflect
on the mistakes of my past.</i>

43
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,065
<i>I had to find a new identity.</i>

44
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,068
<i>A new me.</i>

45
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,489
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

46
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,450
<i>But after a while,
I even opened myself up</i>

47
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,078
<i>to the possibility of new love.</i>

48
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,123
Hi.

49
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,168
Hello, nice baby.

50
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>Here's the thing about new love...</i>

51
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,467
I take payment-in-kind.

52
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,854
<i>...you have to feed it.</i>

53
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,358
<i>Soon enough, I was back on my feet.</i>

54
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,070
<i>Ready to move on, to make new friends.</i>

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,031
<i>She means fucking business!</i>

56
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,638
<i>- Oh, here we go!</i>
- Whip me!

57
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,386
<i>She has taken
a whip from the pivot,</i>

58
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,245
<i>catapulted to the high side!</i>

59
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,955
<i>Oh!</i>

60
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah! Come on!

61
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:37,802
<i>It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</i>

62
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,680
<i>so I really put myself out there.</i>

63
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:43,516
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,149
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

65
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,525
What?

66
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:56,279
I said sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.

67
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,613
Okay.

68
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,911
You broke my fucking legs!

69
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,663
Oh, boo-hoo.

70
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,793
What?

71
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,547
It's not a party without a little drama,
am I right?

72
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,091
Come on! Turn it up!

73
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,385
Shots on the house.

74
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,181
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

75
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,600
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

76
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,059
That was my driver.

77
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,394
Oh, whoops.

78
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,768
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

79
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:31,981
Consider me grateful.

80
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,816
Especially since
I know you don't like me.

81
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,195
I agitate his already delicate sense
of mental equilibrium.

82
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,406
That and his obsessive-compulsive need
to be the center of attention.

83
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,575
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

84
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,537
Not tonight, Romy. Not tonight.

85
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:50,416
Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.

86
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,293
<i>Okay, fine, so I hadn't</i>

87
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,520
<i>told people about the breakup.</i>

88
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,213
<i>But you don't understand.</i>

89
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,672
Find me a new driver.

90
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,842
<i>Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</i>

91
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,096
<i>I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</i>

92
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,016
<i>and no one ever dared to object.</i>

93
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,936
<i>Two for one
You know a bitch buy four</i>

94
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,021
<i>And two left feet
You know I always drop</i>

95
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,731
<i>First thing a girl did
Was a bop</i>

96
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,775
<i>I'm the whole damn cake
And the cherry on top</i>

97
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,194
<i>Shook up the bottom
Made a good girl pop</i>

98
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,672
<i>You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club tryna pipe a Barbie</i>

99
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,323
And don't let him give you shit, okay?

100
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,242
You have to stick up for yourself.

101
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>I don't wanna
Row, row, row the boat</i>

102
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,121
<i>Wrist full of rocks
And I hope I float</i>

103
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,915
<i>Big up yourself
'Cause you know they don't</i>

104
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,351
<i>I chew, chew, chew
'Cause they hope I choke</i>

105
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,669
<i>I'm a bitch, I'm a boss</i>

106
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,712
<i>I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss</i>

107
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,506
<i>I'm a bitch, I'm a boss</i>

108
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,383
<i>I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss</i>

109
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,218
<i>I'm a bitch, I'm a boss</i>

110
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,946
<i>I'm a bitch and a boss
And I shine like gloss</i>

111
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,730
Oh, please.
I give it a few days

112
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,923
before they're back together.

113
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,659
<i>Even when I did
try and tell people,</i>

114
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,851
<i>they didn't believe me.</i>

115
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,286
Come on.
She told me they're really

116
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,996
broken up this time.

117
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,248
Sure they are, Shell.

118
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,649
That's why she's still wearing
that tacky "J" necklace.

119
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,695
She is going to be running
right back into his arms

120
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,071
the minute he snaps his fingers.

121
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,365
If not him,
the next closest alpha male

122
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,592
- with a pulse.
- Mmm-hmm.

123
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,743
Some people just aren't born

124
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,179
- to stand on their own.
- Oh, girl,

125
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,597
- let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

126
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,956
<i>I knew I needed to find</i>

127
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,165
<i>some way to show the world</i>

128
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,335
<i>that I'd cut ties with Mr. J for good.</i>

129
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,628
Harley!

130
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,175
<i>Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.</i>

131
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,427
<i>The Joker and I?</i>

132
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:28,764
<i>Our love bloomed in a highly toxic
industrial processing plant.</i>

133
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,522
<i>And luckily for me,</i>

134
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,649
<i>I have all my best ideas drunk.</i>

135
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,612
I have the best idea!

136
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:53,789
The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,260
This is where it all began, Puddin'.

138
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,722
You motherfucker!

139
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,043
<i>It was the closure I needed.</i>

140
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,544
<i>A fresh start.</i>

141
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,672
<i>A chance to be my own woman.</i>

142
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:59,105
<i>But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.</i>

143
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,192
<i>This is our story.</i>

144
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,239
<i>And I'm telling it, so I'll start
where I fucking want.</i>

145
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,909
<i>Meet the cop.</i>

146
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,577
I got 50 says it was turf war.

147
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,745
<i>Not him.</i>

148
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,432
Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.

149
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,624
<i>Her. Renee Montoya.</i>

150
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,003
<i>Raised on '80s cop shows,
she's always saying cheesy shit like...</i>

151
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,754
There was only one shooter.

152
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,589
Inside.

153
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,883
This guy shot out the glass.

154
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,093
Serrano.

155
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,928
Yo. Hey.

156
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,866
Have Ballistics check for a bullet
in one of those parked cars.

157
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,768
<i>Ten years ago,
she broke a career-making case.</i>

158
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,562
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

159
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,231
<i>But her partner at the time
took all the credit.</i>

160
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,649
<i>So while he made captain,</i>

161
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,110
<i>she got stuck at detective level
with this idiot.</i>

162
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,070
Okay, you think one guy got all four?

163
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,234
Wait, wait, wait.

164
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,532
I'm just saying, we got
four dead bodies here, you know.

165
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,495
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

166
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,495
I'm sorry.
Go ahead and work. Go ahead.

167
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,378
The shooter got close before drawing.
Six rounds.

168
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,398
Two for each of these three.

169
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,733
Yo, mind your debt.

170
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,068
- I'm telling you.
- That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.

171
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,260
- Whoa. Hey.
- Look at this.

172
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,903
- Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

173
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,484
And it wasn't about them.

174
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,279
It was all about this guy, right here.

175
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,368
Do you know who I am?

176
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,371
You fucking bitch.

177
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,300
And this arrow through his throat...

178
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,805
She wanted him to die slowly.

179
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,057
- She?
- We got a hair.

180
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,643
And he's got a new assassin.

181
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,811
Who does?

182
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,023
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

183
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,275
Jesus Christ.

184
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,736
This is Montoya. What the hell was that?

185
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,423
Shit.

186
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,367
Wow.

187
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,845
- Detective.
- Yep?

188
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,412
Found this necklace.

189
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,250
Holy shit.

190
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,961
Good work, Officer.

191
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:28,838
What is it?

192
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,092
Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.

193
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,385
What?

194
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,095
This was their spot.

195
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,098
She just publicly updated
her relationship status.

196
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:43,435
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

197
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,187
She did not think this one through.

198
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,606
<i>Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</i>

199
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:52,069
<i>I'm about to learn that a lot of people
in this city want me dead.</i>

200
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,447
<i>And at the top of that list is this guy.</i>

201
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,077
Mr. Keo
and his lovely wife and daughter.

202
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,788
You kinda forced my hand here.

203
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,207
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.

204
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,464
I gave you a great pitch. Didn't I?

205
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,968
And I thought... Shh!

206
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,556
I thought we could
build something beautiful together.

207
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,391
I thought we could be family.

208
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,199
I'm gonna set you free.

209
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,534
Mmm...

210
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:46,207
What about her?

211
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,838
I think we can let her go.

212
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,758
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

213
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,515
Baby. Aww.

214
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,434
Don't cry.

215
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,314
Thank you.
Thank you.

216
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,690
You're welcome.

217
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,319
Is that a snot bubble?

218
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,613
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

219
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,199
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

220
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,326
No. No!

221
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,121
<i>The wackjob with the penchant</i>

222
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,041
<i>for peeling faces
is Roman Sionis,</i>

223
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,167
<i>aka</i>

224
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,086
<i>Black Mask.</i>

225
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,509
<i>The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.</i>

226
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,387
<i>See, I was halfway across town,</i>

227
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,890
<i>hungover, and thinking about breakfast.</i>

228
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:51,146
<i>Egg, bacon, American cheese.</i>

229
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,485
<i>Soft, toasted buttered roll.</i>

230
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,113
<i>Just a dash of hot sauce.</i>

231
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,656
Not too much, Sal.

232
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,950
I wanna taste the cheese.

233
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,953
<i>What a way to start my new life.</i>

234
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,417
<i>With the perfect egg sandwich.</i>

235
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,085
Mmm!

236
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,213
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

237
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,885
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?
I promise.

238
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,097
That's all the money
I got in the world,

239
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,890
and it's so worth it.

240
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,272
<i>I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</i>

241
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,817
<i>or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,</i>

242
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,571
<i>but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.</i>

243
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,698
I mean it, Sal. No one.

244
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,299
Freeze! Gotham PD.

245
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,052
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

246
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,845
Are you fucking kidding me?

247
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,934
Yo! Police.

248
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,103
<i>It had been six short hours</i>

249
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,315
<i>since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals
announced to the world</i>

250
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:19,109
<i>that Mr. J and I were dunzo.</i>

251
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,030
<i>The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</i>

252
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,617
<i>Cops who never would've dared
come after me before</i>

253
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,660
<i>were suddenly doing this.</i>

254
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,293
Ooh!

255
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,586
Freeze!

256
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,236
- <i>And what's worse?</i>
- Move!

257
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,507
<i>Every person I ever wronged
now felt free</i>

258
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,110
<i>to come and take their pound of flesh.</i>

259
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,237
<i>Turns out I wronged a lot of people.</i>

260
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,991
Come on, boy. Get him!

261
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,452
Oh...

262
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,468
Finally.

263
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:36,979
<i>And then...</i>

264
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,540
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

265
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,940
<i>...tragedy struck.</i>

266
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:54,580
<i>It took losing something I truly love</i>

267
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,583
<i>for me to see
that the target on my back</i>

268
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,917
<i>was bigger than I thought.</i>

269
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,087
Freeze.

270
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,423
<i>With the walls
closing in around me,</i>

271
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,508
<i>I made a carefully calculated,</i>

272
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,719
<i>highly strategic move.</i>

273
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,689
<i>Fine. It was dumb luck. But still...</i>

274
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,065
That felt pretty great.

275
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,530
Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.

276
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,990
See ya. Oh!

277
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,117
There she is.

278
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:33,577
Harley Quinn.

279
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,329
Yeah?

280
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,706
I've waited a long time for this.

281
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,583
You have?

282
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,126
Oh...

283
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,420
I haven't had breakfast yet.

284
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,298
What did I do to you?

285
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,925
Are you serious?

286
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,636
Look at my face.

287
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,847
Look at my face!

288
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,063
Oh...

289
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,107
That wasn't me.

290
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,943
But you dared him to do it.

291
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,588
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

292
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,656
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

293
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,699
That means

294
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,536
there's no one here to stop me.

295
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,765
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

296
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,082
Ooh. A penny.

297
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,839
They're shooting arrows now?

298
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,434
Ah, crap.

299
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,936
Him, too?

300
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,239
Parley?

301
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:59,079
Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

302
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,289
Not today, Simpson.

303
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,833
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,918
I mean, your elderly.

305
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,689
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

306
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:08,964
You wanna go there?

307
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,091
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

308
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,510
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

309
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,680
Thought by now you'd figure out
how not to get caught.

310
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,349
What? No comeback?

311
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,271
You all right?

312
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,190
You smell like shit.

313
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,445
Yo, Simpson.

314
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,406
Any clean clothes in lost and found?

315
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,329
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

316
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,166
The Sionis family name is on
half the museums and schools in Gotham.

317
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,710
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

318
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.</i>

319
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,716
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

320
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>That's him.</i>

321
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,053
He had four people killed
alone last night.

322
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,055
If Roman Sionis is such a mastermind,

323
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,140
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

324
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,185
The Janus Corporation is
his father's company, thank you.

325
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,145
And by the way, they cut him off.

326
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,148
Where does the DA's office stand
on all this?

327
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,555
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

328
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,360
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

329
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,779
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

330
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,447
There's a shipment coming in.

331
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,990
Drugs?

332
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,477
- A diamond.
- A diamond.

333
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,494
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

334
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,746
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

335
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,830
His driver.

336
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,100
He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

337
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,519
And he said that he overheard something
about laser-encoding.

338
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:29,920
Now, I did some research.

339
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,589
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

340
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,342
You remember
the Bertinelli massacre, right?

341
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,927
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

342
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,845
<i>Fifteen years ago, one of the wealthiest</i>

343
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,515
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

344
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,142
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

345
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,730
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret offshore bank accounts,</i>

346
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,541
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

347
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,027
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

348
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

349
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,157
<i>And with it,
the only key to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

350
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,787
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

351
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,831
That's what makes him so dangerous.

352
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,541
He's already building an army.

353
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,917
If he gets the diamond,

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
he'll have all the money
and connections

355
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,923
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

356
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,967
You said you had someone on the inside?

357
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,720
Yes. He's...

358
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,841
He's no longer there, but...

359
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,557
So basically, you have nothing.

360
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,143
You are trying to go after

361
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,979
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

362
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,148
and all you've got
is rumors and a hunch?

363
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,983
Well, you know,

364
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,106
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

365
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,486
Isn't that right, Miss Yee?

366
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,655
Listen, if the DA is
willing to throw himself

367
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,283
out in front of this, it's fine with me.

368
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,492
Captain, no.

369
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,872
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

370
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,999
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

371
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,417
This is my case, okay?

372
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,184
I've been working on this
for six months.

373
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:56,214
We need something that
we can actually use, Detective.

374
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,884
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

375
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,983
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I...
- No.

376
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,226
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

377
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,936
Me? He gave my case away.

378
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,104
Oh, poor Renee.

379
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,124
Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
It's almost noon.

380
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,149
Wow.

381
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,988
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

382
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,257
<i>Why the fuck haven't you</i>

383
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,176
<i>been picking up your phone?
We've got a situation.</i>

384
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,534
What... What situation?

385
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,952
<i>You didn't hear this from me,</i>

386
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,205
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

387
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,611
She's got the diamond,
and trust me, Roman will kill her.

388
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,376
- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
<i>- This kid.</i>

389
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,505
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

390
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,590
Holy fuck.

391
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,310
Can I help you?

392
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,954
Why, yes. Yes, you can.

393
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,064
I'm here to report a terrible crime.

394
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,943
And what terrible crime is that?

395
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,488
This one.

396
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,173
Hi, boys.

397
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,513
Meeting's over.

398
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,198
Run, piggy, run.

399
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,000
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

400
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,713
<i>Hold up, hold up.
I'm telling this all wrong.</i>

401
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:42,881
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

402
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,509
<i>For you to understand why me, the cop,
and that dame on the toilet...</i>

403
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,802
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

404
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,555
<i>...are all looking
for this Cain character...</i>

405
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,807
<i>I gotta take you back a few days,</i>

406
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,645
<i>to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.</i>

407
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:04,319
<i>This is a man's world</i>

408
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:11,993
<i>This is a man's world</i>

409
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,828
<i>This is Dinah Lance.</i>

410
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,997
<i>But it would be nothing</i>

411
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,644
<i>But she prefers Black Canary.</i>

412
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:21,002
<i>Nothing</i>

413
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,671
<i>She's got a killer voice.</i>

414
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,256
<i>Without a woman or a girl</i>

415
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,776
<i>But there was some other shit</i>

416
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,801
<i>going down that night.</i>

417
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,344
...short notice like this.

418
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,763
I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.

419
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,976
I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

420
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,896
The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.

421
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,481
I can.

422
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,025
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

423
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,195
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

424
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,573
there are no limits
to what we could achieve together.

425
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,493
I'm building something special.

426
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,371
I appreciate your offer, Mr. Sionis.

427
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:01,793
But with all due respect,
the Golden Lions are a family business.

428
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,588
Fuck family.
All due respect, but fuck that.

429
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,875
Family's a fucking illusion.

430
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,217
You know what my family gave me?
Nothing.

431
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,011
I know what everyone says.

432
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,140
"Here comes Roman Sionis.
He was handed life on a silver spoon."

433
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,225
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

434
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,936
Blah, blah, blah. Fake fucking fucks.

435
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,149
But look at me now.

436
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,693
I've located the Bertinelli diamond.

437
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,695
I'm about to own this city.

438
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,613
Not just the East End.

439
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,574
I am thinking big, baby.

440
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,659
And I want you there with me.

441
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,662
We could make our own family.

442
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,872
Mr. Sionis,

443
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,083
the Golden Lions have operated in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.

444
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,087
We have no need of your protection.

445
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,882
<i>He's gonna regret that.</i>

446
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,018
Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

447
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,728
Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,

448
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,272
and I'll come see you at the docks,
day after tomorrow.

449
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,523
Okay?

450
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:16,326
<i>This is a man's world</i>

451
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,161
<i>It would be nothing</i>

452
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,039
<i>Without a woman or a girl</i>

453
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,376
Who's having a good time?
You are.

454
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,045
<i>Lost in the wilderness</i>

455
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,452
Food is good?

456
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,090
Do you need any more cocktails?

457
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,341
<i>Lost in the bitterness</i>

458
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,176
Your good health.

459
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,929
<i>He's lost in the loneliness</i>

460
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,516
<i>He's lost</i>

461
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,977
<i>This is a man's world</i>

462
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,272
<i>It wouldn't be nothing</i>

463
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:59,369
<i>Without a woman or a girl</i>

464
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,791
<i>Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.</i>

465
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:05,959
Come on!

466
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,794
<i>He calls her his little bird,</i>

467
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,589
<i>and he's got her wrapped
right around his fancy little finger.</i>

468
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,180
- Here you go, Canary.
- Thank you.

469
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,143
How do you spell "mercenary"?

470
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,395
Merceninny...

471
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,730
Merceran?

472
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,447
Singer lady woman!

473
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,450
You're really, really good.

474
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:40,952
Yeah.

475
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,335
Know what a harlequin is?

476
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,882
Janky-ass clown with bad eye makeup?

477
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,508
Oof!

478
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,552
Ouch!

479
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,474
A harlequin's role

480
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,644
is to serve.

481
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,980
An audience.

482
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,524
A master.

483
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,447
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

484
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:24,370
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

485
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,174
Yeah, I don't know who you think I am,
lady, but I'm not her.

486
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,803
Puddin' and I broke up.

487
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,563
I haven't told that to anyone.

488
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,566
Yeah.

489
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,902
For good this time.

490
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,282
And for the first time in a long time,

491
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,702
I'm all on my lonesome.

492
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,917
It's great.

493
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,089
Welcome to the club.

494
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,549
Thanks.

495
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,762
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

496
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,639
- Yes!
- Yeah?

497
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,307
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

498
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,893
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

499
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,273
Hey.

500
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,326
We're all good here.

501
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,092
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

502
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,635
No.

503
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,848
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

504
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,809
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

505
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,078
Are we getting breakfast?

506
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,812
Hey, buddy,
I'm gonna need some help.

507
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,439
This is my friend.

508
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,648
I told you all about...

509
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,293
Hey, get the door, man.
I got her, I got her.

510
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,152
- There we go.
- Wait.

511
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,279
Isn't that Joker's girl?

512
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,447
Not anymore.

513
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,813
Got room for one more?

514
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,907
Hey.

515
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,285
Huh?

516
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,124
I don't need your help. I got this.

517
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,960
You got this? You sure about that?

518
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,421
Yeah, no wonder everyone hates you.

519
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,634
Uh...

520
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:54,895
You got this!

521
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,858
You motherfucker!

522
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,903
Whoo!

523
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,368
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

524
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,746
Could that be our little Miss Lance?

525
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:16,417
All these years, I thought she was just
a pretty face and a fine set of lungs.

526
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,045
Ooh.

527
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:24,300
Mr. Zsasz, I've had an amazing idea.

528
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,143
That's my little bird.

529
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:40,441
Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.

530
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:41,977
Shut up.

531
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,197
Oh, songbird.

532
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,950
You drive as good as you fight?

533
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:52,995
Who's asking?

534
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,580
The boss.

535
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,541
You're getting promoted.

536
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,170
You're his new driver.

537
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:04,924
Huh. Thanks, but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.

538
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,926
You'll be good at the driving gig.

539
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:12,390
Be here tomorrow. 9:00 a.m. Sharp.

540
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,059
<i>So, that's how Canary
got herself a job</i>

541
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,478
<i>driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.</i>

542
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,315
<i>A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant</i>

543
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,026
<i>without the help of yours truly.</i>

544
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,865
<i>Red for the light
Gotta stop this thing</i>

545
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,367
<i>Find a song to sing
That is everything</i>

546
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,452
Morning.

547
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,495
<i>That I meant to say</i>

548
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:39,041
<i>I meant to say</i>

549
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,524
You're
the one who wanted the kid!

550
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,133
I never wanted her!

551
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,137
Let me guess. Parents?

552
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,055
Foster parents.

553
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,223
Right.

554
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,767
Sorry, kid.

555
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,562
Sorry about your face.

556
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:02,732
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

557
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,068
You should've seen
the other guy.

558
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:09,614
Uh...

559
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,801
I want
that kid out of my fucking house!

560
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,161
You know, kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.

561
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:18,164
You just gotta hang in there.

562
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,838
Get something to eat.

563
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,134
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

564
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,023
Don't talk to me like that.

565
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:44,875
<i>Canary spends the next week</i>

566
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,444
<i>settling in to her newjob
as Roman's personal driver.</i>

567
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,330
Ew. Okay.

568
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>What she didn't know
is that driving Mr. Face-peely-pants</i>

569
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,002
<i>was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs</i>

570
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,380
<i>of my favorite little piggy.</i>

571
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,257
Dinah Lance?

572
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,716
Who the hell are you?

573
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,136
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

574
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,351
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

575
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,228
Oh, really?

576
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:26,232
He told me that there was
a shipment coming in. A diamond.

577
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,734
A very special diamond.

578
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,114
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

579
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,599
Do you know who you're working for?

580
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,763
You're damn right, I do.
He's the man who gave me a job.

581
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,122
Took me off the streets.

582
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,958
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

583
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,794
A criminal. A murderer.

584
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,481
What would your mother think of
you working for a guy like that?

585
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,717
You have the same power she had.

586
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,643
Don't you think
she would want you to use it?

587
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,470
The hell do you know about my mother?

588
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,599
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

589
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,684
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

590
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,520
She was a damn good woman.

591
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,815
The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.

592
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,152
And when she was found
dead in the street,

593
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,655
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

594
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,243
Now you wanna come and knock on my door
and ask me to help you out

595
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,621
and make the same mistake she did?

596
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,208
Yeah. Good luck with that.

597
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,045
That's fair enough.

598
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,589
And I'm sorry for your loss.

599
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,425
For the record,

600
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,804
that would never happen on my watch.

601
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,726
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

602
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,646
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

603
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,939
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

604
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,109
It sure did, boss.

605
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,153
It sure fucking did.

606
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,530
Crossbow Killer

607
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,241
struck again last night.

608
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,535
Rossi and four of his guys.

609
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,538
People don't kill people I own
without my permission.

610
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,540
Why doesn't this crossbow guy know that?

611
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,167
- You know that!
- I know it.

612
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:11,295
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?

613
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,631
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

614
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,175
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

615
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,386
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

616
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,013
We're just finishing up
a little business. Look around.

617
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,140
- You're late.
- It's fine.

618
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,243
Should she come back another time,
'cause she's late?

619
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,103
No. Isn't this stunning?

620
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,857
That is a Chokwe mask.

621
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:35,236
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

622
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,405
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

623
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:38,656
- I've never been.
- Mmm.

624
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,779
I've heard it's beautiful.

625
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,492
- It's dirty.
- Oh...

626
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,579
Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

627
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,248
Shuar of Ecuador.

628
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,975
They're amazing people.
Surprisingly gentle.

629
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,001
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

630
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,254
Mmm. They boil the heads
of their enemies

631
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,089
and they make
these little fellas.

632
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,966
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

633
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,261
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

634
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,221
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

635
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,157
And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.

636
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,225
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

637
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,018
These are ancient acupuncture models.

638
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,730
As you can see,
they have all the acupuncture points.

639
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,899
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

640
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,986
Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.

641
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,529
All right, all right,

642
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,212
let's find the Crossbow Killer.
I get it.

643
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,742
Is he an acupuncture model, too?

644
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,911
He is not an acupuncture model.
This is a statue of me.

645
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,838
It was made by a very famous
Gotham artist...

646
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,540
Harley Quinn did it.

647
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,835
Some kind of "fuck you" to the Joker.

648
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,587
They split.

649
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,631
What's wrong with you, Victor?

650
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,469
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

651
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,929
This is spectacular news!

652
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,849
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

653
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,142
Have the boys go find her.

654
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,394
Round her up, bring her back.
I want her.

655
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,438
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

656
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,857
Something super-duper important, okay?

657
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,275
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

658
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,202
- Yeah, go with Victor.
- It's just a pickup.

659
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,695
No, he's harmless.

660
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,655
Do as you're told. Go.

661
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,005
All right. We can go.

662
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:19,507
I'll take that.

663
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,073
Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.

664
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,968
Go get your car.

665
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:28,724
<i>That rock.
That rock's about to become the key</i>

666
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,353
<i>to whether or not I live
to enjoy my newfound independence.</i>

667
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,441
Get off me.

668
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,068
What the hell are you doing here?

669
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,820
You're not the only one
who makes money

670
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,822
off of dumb, rich, white people.

671
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,114
Well, you know what?

672
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,242
One day you're gonna
pick the wrong pocket, sis.

673
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,536
Okay. Whatever.

674
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,499
Dumb-ass kids.

675
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,211
Excuse me. Sorry.

676
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,472
I really like your earrings.

677
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,599
Why, thank you.

678
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,103
There's the thief. There's the thief.

679
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:17,898
Get off of me!

680
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,568
That little girl took my watch.

681
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,403
I didn't do nothing.

682
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,341
Where the fuck's the diamond?

683
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,867
I just fucking had it.

684
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,451
Cass!

685
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,038
Wait!

686
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,415
Wait, wait!

687
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,209
Halt!

688
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,044
Fuck!

689
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,399
<i>In the storytelling business,</i>

690
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,694
<i>this dummy swallowing that diamond</i>

691
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,488
<i>is called a complication.</i>

692
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,160
<i>A complication
I didn't exactly need right now.</i>

693
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:15,164
Parley?

694
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,419
We lost the diamond.

695
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,629
What?

696
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,505
We're really sorry, Mr. S. This kid...

697
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,799
We never even got our hands on it.

698
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,218
Ow!

699
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,305
Help!

700
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,390
Get out! Get out of here!

701
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,810
You, too! Go! With your fucking sage
stinking my place up.

702
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:37,977
Fuck off!

703
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,188
Here she is.

704
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:40,940
She's a child!

705
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,167
- Mr. Sionis.
- She's just a kid.

706
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,192
She's... What?

707
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,611
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

708
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,071
Fuck off! Get out.

709
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,697
Fucking out!

710
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,407
Fuck! These are my things.

711
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,076
- This diamond is my things.
- Yes.

712
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,242
My things!

713
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,454
Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

714
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,290
- No.
- Why is this happening to me? Why?

715
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,919
I'm gonna get your diamond back.

716
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,254
I promise.

717
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:09,551
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

718
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,846
Blow off a little steam.

719
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:16,141
Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.

720
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,688
Okay. I'll go get changed.

721
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,621
Shit, Cass.

722
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,046
I don't care what it takes,
I want my diamond back.

723
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,382
We're working on it.

724
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:51,218
Now, let's go have a little fun.

725
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,769
Harleen Quinzel.

726
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,187
Whoo!

727
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:04,857
Hiya, Romy.

728
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,111
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

729
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,839
<i>When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</i>

730
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:13,365
<i>there are a lot of possible answers
to this question.</i>

731
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:14,825
<i>Breaking his driver's legs.</i>

732
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,386
<i>There's that time
I called it an "expresso."</i>

733
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,620
<i>Having a vagina in the first place
pisses this guy off.</i>

734
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,711
<i>Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</i>

735
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,130
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

736
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:30,382
You're gonna do that thing
where you open up

737
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,009
a weird-ass case of torture devices

738
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,553
while inexplicably
detailing your master plan

739
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,929
and how I don't fit into it.

740
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,932
- I'm building a better...
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!

741
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,559
You're building a criminal empire

742
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,078
because Daddy kicked you out
of Janus Corp.

743
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,955
And you think this is a big "fuck you,"
but in actuality

744
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,915
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

745
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:49,276
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

746
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:50,503
And you're really not as clever
as you think,

747
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,527
because now I'm gonna slice your...

748
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,572
Oh, Jesus Christmas.

749
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,908
Now you're gonna say
that you wanna kill me

750
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,785
to set an example.
Christ, you're boring.

751
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,496
- I wanna kill you...
- Shit.

752
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,790
...because without the Joker around,

753
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,959
I can.

754
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:12,091
For all your noise and bluster,

755
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,344
you're just a silly little girl
with no one around to protect her.

756
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,934
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

757
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,685
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

758
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,538
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

759
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,415
Come on. There's gotta be something,

760
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,559
something we can figure out. Hey!

761
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,568
Wait, wait! You lost something, right?

762
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,671
You lost something.
I heard you say it.

763
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:34,696
A diamond.

764
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,495
Yeah.

765
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:45,040
I can help you find it.

766
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:48,168
Seriously.
Look in my pocket.

767
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,631
Other pocket.

768
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,170
I'm starting up my own business.

769
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,492
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

770
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,817
I know the East End better than anybody.

771
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,737
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

772
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,241
Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,

773
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,702
and I found it in a bird's nest
in Robinson Park.

774
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:23,954
If you let me go,

775
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:27,958
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

776
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,245
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

777
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,129
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

778
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:34,673
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

779
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,216
You're so tiresome!

780
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,511
If you want my mercy,

781
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:42,556
shut that hole in the middle
of your face and listen.

782
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,684
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

783
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:56,528
<i>A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental</i>

784
00:44:56,695 --> 00:45:00,324
<i>But diamonds are
a girl's best friend</i>

785
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,161
<i>A kiss may be grand</i>

786
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:08,248
<i>But it won't pay the rental

<i>I will be waiting.</i>

<i>Diamonds are a girl's best</i>

798
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,819
I'll give you till midnight.

799
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:42,115
And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face

800
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:43,992
and pickle it.

801
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,911
Okay?

802
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,666
<i>Call me old-fashioned,</i>

803
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,044
<i>but I always thought the guy
was meant to get the girl a diamond.</i>

804
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:02,135
I won't let you down, Romy. I promise.

805
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,221
Let's make it half a mil.

806
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,473
It's more fun if she's got competition.

807
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,434
Send it to every mercenary in Gotham.

808
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,937
Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.

809
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:14,314
Hey, you're the asshole no one likes.

810
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:34,793
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

811
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,120
<i>We've got a situation.</i>

812
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,629
<i>This kid,
she's got the diamond.</i>

813
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,589
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

814
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,133
Holy fuck.

815
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,346
Where can I find Cassandra Cain?

816
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,307
<i>Okay. Now we're good.</i>

817
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,061
Cell seven.

818
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,485
Thanks, doll. You're a peach.

819
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:04,239
Hey, I know that guy.

820
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,136
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

821
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,138
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

822
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,891
<i>Access denied.
Access denied. Denied.</i>

823
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,727
<i>Denied. Denied. Denied.
Denied. Denied. Denied.</i>

824
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,774
Hmm. Perfect.

825
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,391
Hold up, hold up.

826
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,255
- Remember me?
- She stole my car!

827
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:58,811
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

828
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,605
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

829
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,506
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

830
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,591
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

831
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,385
Yeah, sorry about that.

832
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,761
You're dead!

833
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,988
I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!

834
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,305
Hey, kid.

835
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,265
You're that psycho

836
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:13,493
- from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

837
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:14,935
Are you Cassandra Cain?

838
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,269
Yeah.

839
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:29,366
I need to know where...

840
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:41,670
Hold, please.

841
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:43,296
Harley...

842
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,482
<i>Let you think you get the picture</i>

843
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:47,300
<i>Bitch, you don't know
How good I treat ya</i>

844
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,178
<i>Shake it off
This pride and glory</i>

845
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:53,014
<i>You dig up so many stories</i>

846
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:55,725
<i>Oh, you're so under the thumb</i>

847
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,562
<i>Four fingers from a knuckle sandwich</i>

848
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:01,148
<i>Try my blood
It's just a starter</i>

849
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:04,151
<i>No one tastes like me, yeah</i>

850
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:08,530
<i>I'm pretty like a car crash</i>

851
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,074
<i>Ugly as a lullaby</i>

852
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,785
<i>You really wanna try it</i>

853
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,371
<i>Experiment on me</i>

854
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:18,582
<i>Experiment on me</i>

855
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,376
<i>Experiment on me</i>

856
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:25,213
<i>Experiment on me</i>

857
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,128
Hmm.

858
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,800
I got you, you little shit.

859
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,386
Who are you guys?

860
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,181
Go, go, go.

861
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,644
Keep the kid alive.

862
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,287
Mmm!

863
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:29,921
<i>Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

864
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,631
<i>Yeah Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

865
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,800
<i>Black Betty had a child, bam-ba-lam</i>

866
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,176
<i>Damn thing gone wild, bam-ba-lam</i>

867
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,429
<i>She's always ready, bam-ba-lam</i>

868
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,431
<i>She's all rock steady, bam-ba-lam</i>

869
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:40,932
<i>Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

870
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,602
<i>Yeah Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

871
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,441
<i>All right</i>

872
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,746
<i>Whoa Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

873
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,539
<i>Go Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i>

874
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,583
<i>Really gets me high, bam-ba-lam</i>

875
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:22,389
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

876
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,391
A little help.

877
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,850
<i>All right</i>

878
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:28,687
<i>All right</i>

879
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,397
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

880
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,566
Mmm...

881
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,650
<i>All right</i>

882
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,445
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

883
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,079
Does she have to keep running?

884
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,860
Roman, you trustafarian fuckbag.

885
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,155
You!

886
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,365
You!

887
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:22,117
Step away from the kid.

888
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:24,327
Drop it.

889
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,121
The phone?

890
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:27,997
Sure.

891
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,054
Mmm.

892
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,409
Whoa.

893
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,369
Oh, good. You're awake.

894
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,246
Toss that for me, will ya?

895
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,053
What the fuck?

896
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,972
Who did I just blow up?

897
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,057
Either someone who wants me dead,

898
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:29,476
or someone looking to collect

899
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:31,279
the half-million dollar reward
on your head.

900
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,480
Half a million dollars?

901
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:34,898
Yeah.

902
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,484
Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?

903
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,861
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

904
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,821
Now, uncuff me.

905
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:43,740
Oh, sure.

906
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:45,217
As soon as you give me the diamond.

907
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,868
What diamond?

908
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,584
Fuck you!

909
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:57,545
Look at me.

910
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,758
What?

911
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:04,052
I don't know nothing about no diamond.

912
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:06,530
The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,

913
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,516
and the fact that you're a filthy
little thief, all suggest that you do.

914
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,101
Now, you can give it to me,
or I can give you

915
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:13,728
to the man that diamond belongs to.

916
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,897
But trust me when I say,
you're not gonna like

917
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,023
what he's gonna do to ya.

918
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,527
Now, hand it over.

919
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:23,530
Yeah, not gonna happen.

920
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,659
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

921
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:28,993
One more time.

922
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,787
- I can't give it to you.
- Why not?

923
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,872
Because I ate it, okay?

924
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,130
Yes.

925
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:43,883
What are we even doing here?

926
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,053
There are two ways
that diamond's coming outta ya.

927
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,430
This way,

928
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:52,433
or this way.

929
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:55,937
That's what I thought.

930
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,814
Also, I'm outta groceries.

931
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,112
So, how long you been a mercenary?

932
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,531
Hey, where did you get...

933
00:56:06,698 --> 00:56:09,033
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

934
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,910
you haven't even thought
about my left.

935
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:13,079
Your left hand is cuffed to mine.

936
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,544
I'll have to learn that one.

937
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,921
Can we get this?

938
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,757
You're not gonna try to run, are you?

939
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,051
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

940
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:29,898
I figure I'm better off with
the person who's not gonna cut me open.

941
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,182
Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.

942
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,518
I do not care that you're a kid.

943
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,772
I saw that.

944
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,568
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

945
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:47,030
I mean, shopping at fancy-ass stores,

946
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,283
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

947
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,244
How'd you do it?
Come on, tell me.

948
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,579
Woman to woman.

949
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:59,208
Being a pickpocket's fine and all,
but I got real potential.

950
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,252
I mean, how do I be like you?

951
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:05,006
Well, except for the crazy part.
But other than that.

952
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,593
Number one, no one is like me.

953
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,804
If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.

954
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:14,933
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

955
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,311
Fall in love with your patient,
break said patient out of said asylum.

956
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:19,562
Begin a life of crime.

957
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:22,041
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

958
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:23,733
Get arrested by the Batman.

959
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,586
Go back to jail, get out of jail
with a bomb on your neck.

960
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,171
Save the world, go back to jail,
and break out of jail

961
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:29,572
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

962
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:31,366
and going out on your own.

963
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,120
Number two...

964
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:39,499
Six bucks for tap water
with a fucking cucumber stick in it?

965
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:40,667
That's crazy.

966
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,545
I'm not shopping at this store.

967
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:47,632
I'm robbing this store.

968
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,969
Consider this your first lesson.

969
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,221
Paying is for dummies.

970
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:00,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

971
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,814
Move it!

972
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:09,737
Whoops. Ah...

973
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,826
This is Doc's Place. And this is Doc.

974
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:19,372
Lotus flower!

975
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:22,000
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

976
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:26,254
He's the Taiwanese grandpa I never had.
He knows everything and everyone.

977
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,107
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

978
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,507
without Doc knowing about it.

979
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:32,093
And he happens to be the only person

980
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,512
who actually cares about me.

981
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,180
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

982
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:39,892
She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.

983
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,312
Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.

984
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:45,082
So you don't have
to taste his cooking.

985
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:47,859
Lotus flower, you have to get upstairs
before someone sees.

986
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,361
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

987
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:52,572
We know.

988
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,950
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

989
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,994
you have to show them
that you're serious.

990
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:01,164
Blow something up. Shoot someone.

991
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,542
Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.

992
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:06,586
Shut that door. Lock it.

993
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,130
Keep your sticky paws to yourself, okay?

994
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,184
This place...

995
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,550
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

996
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,313
...is so fucking dope.

997
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,401
Oh, shit. Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

998
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,404
I named him Bruce
after that hunky Wayne guy.

999
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,324
He's my little dumpling, aren't you?

1000
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:38,576
Aren't you, my little baby?

1001
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,661
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.

1002
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,455
I love you.

1003
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:47,585
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

1004
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,798
Who, that? It's Cass.

1005
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,760
You're so pretty.

1006
00:59:57,804 --> 00:59:59,472
Who's this?

1007
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,808
It's a beaver.

1008
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:03,184
Hmm.

1009
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:09,899
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1010
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,027
What's this?

1011
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,075
It's art. Don't touch.

1012
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:23,913
He your ex or something?

1013
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:26,124
You don't know who that is?

1014
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,793
The Joker.

1015
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,587
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1016
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,422
My former partner in madness?

1017
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:35,842
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1018
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:37,885
You've never heard of him?

1019
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:40,096
Well, sounds like a dick.

1020
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:44,267
Huh.

1021
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,570
Milk.

1022
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:09,876
<i>I'm not going soft
or nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

1023
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,253
<i>it was kinda nice having the kid around.</i>

1024
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,892
Give me a #32. Mild.

1025
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,019
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1026
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,541
Who are you?

1027
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,959
They call me...

1028
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,254
H...

1029
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:57,298
<i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

1030
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,716
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

1031
01:02:03,012 --> 01:02:08,142
<i>Meet the daughter of the richest,
most powerful Mafia don in Gotham City.</i>

1032
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:10,770
<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

1033
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:13,314
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

1034
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:18,861
<i>One day, she comes home to find
her whole family in the living room.</i>

1035
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:20,154
Momma.

1036
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:26,327
<i>Anyone and everyone
with Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

1037
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:31,582
<i>Oh, and that? That's Stefano Galante.</i>

1038
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:35,336
<i>The guy making the play for
the Bertinelli turf and fortune.</i>

1039
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:02,571
<i>When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,</i>

1040
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:07,034
<i>the big softy sneaks her outta there
and hides her away in Sicily.</i>

1041
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:12,456
<i>Where she is raised by his own
father and brother. Both assassins.</i>

1042
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:24,093
<i>She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.</i>

1043
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:26,846
<i>So, she starts training.</i>

1044
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:29,974
<i>When she was ready,</i>

1045
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:31,267
<i>and by "ready" I mean</i>

1046
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,394
<i>a badass motherfucking
killing machine,</i>

1047
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:39,984
<i>she moves back to Gotham.
Starts working on that kill list.</i>

1048
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,911
<i>She has the murder stuff down,
but the rest?</i>

1049
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,121
Do you know who I am?

1050
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:54,707
Do you know who I am?

1051
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:56,235
<i>Still a work in progress.</i>

1052
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,296
Do you know who I am?

1053
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:01,881
The Crossbow Killer.

1054
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,132
They call me...

1055
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:05,176
The Crossbow Killer.

1056
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:06,886
They call me...

1057
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:09,722
The Crossbow Killer?

1058
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,057
They call me...

1059
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:15,353
Huntress.

1060
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,064
<i>She calls herself Huntress.</i>

1061
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,566
<i>Fucking fabulous, if you ask me.</i>

1062
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:23,611
And who are you looking for?

1063
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:31,410
Great club.

1064
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:32,703
Quinn got the girl.

1065
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,121
And?

1066
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,415
And they disappeared.

1067
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,252
Fuck!

1068
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,047
Fuck!

1069
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:51,222
What is she laughing at?

1070
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,266
Is she laughing at me?

1071
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,434
She is.

1072
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,186
No, she's not. She's...

1073
01:04:57,812 --> 01:04:59,563
What are you laughing at, Erika?

1074
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,108
Roman, you gotta hear this.

1075
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,110
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

1076
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:05,945
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1077
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,155
You're being a total kook.

1078
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,200
Get on the fucking table.

1079
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,080
This is my club. Get up now.

1080
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,207
- Okay.
- Now.

1081
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,169
Whoa.

1082
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,756
Now, dance.

1083
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,014
Dance. Dance, Erika!

1084
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,474
Okay.

1085
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:45,651
This dress is fucking hideous.

1086
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:48,571
Take it off.

1087
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,991
Take your dress off.

1088
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:56,287
Get up there and fucking cut it off her.

1089
01:05:57,455 --> 01:05:58,873
Do it now!

1090
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,375
Take her fucking dress off.

1091
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:03,836
Just rip it off her. Hurry up!

1092
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,254
Hurry up!

1093
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:08,774
- Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1094
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:09,884
Do it.

1095
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:16,140
Yeah. Beautiful.

1096
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:34,116
You wouldn't betray me, would you?

1097
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:38,662
I was just gonna
go look for the girl.

1098
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,831
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

1099
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:43,292
I want you to stay here with me close.

1100
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:46,670
You soothe me, little bird.

1101
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,436
Oh, good. You got it.

1102
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:03,854
Did you trace the messages?

1103
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,398
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

1104
01:07:06,482 --> 01:07:07,842
and then had it sent to my office.

1105
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:10,736
Renee, what were you thinking?

1106
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:13,447
Roman is the one
that put a price on the kid's head.

1107
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,199
Okay? I had to.

1108
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,577
- I can't get into it right now...
- Renee, you need help.

1109
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:20,079
What are you talking about?

1110
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,331
She's right.

1111
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:26,669
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

1112
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:28,963
What?

1113
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:31,006
I'm sorry. Okay?

1114
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,883
You gave me no choice.

1115
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,802
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:36,971
You're suspended.

1117
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,224
Your badge and your gun, now.

1118
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,523
<i>If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,</i>

1119
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:50,359
<i>you know that
this is when shit gets real.</i>

1120
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:52,194
What's the point of the badge,

1121
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:56,073
when it means fuck all anyway?

1122
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,326
Right, Captain?

1123
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:04,164
<i>No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.</i>

1124
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:10,796
<i>Which would've had me worried,
only I had more pressing concerns.</i>

1125
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:14,675
And that is why you should never partake
in paying federal income taxes.

1126
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,177
Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

1127
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:21,890
Thank you.

1128
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,018
Anyway, lesson 37.

1129
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,221
Why...

1130
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,272
You said they wouldn't find us.

1131
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,317
Chillax. No one knows we're here.

1132
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:34,194
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1133
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,863
Okay. So they know.

1134
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,489
Let's scram.

1135
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:41,035
Open the door.

1136
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,412
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1137
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:44,826
Bruce, come here.

1138
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,473
I can hear you!
Open the door.

1139
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:48,584
What is that?

1140
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:52,046
See you in hell, Harley!

1141
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,342
Get under the table!

1142
01:08:58,636 --> 01:09:00,554
Bruce? Bruce!

1143
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:01,764
Come here! No!

1144
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,442
Bruce?

1145
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,780
Come here, boy. Bruce?

1146
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:21,784
Bruce?

1147
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:24,453
Bruce?

1148
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,040
This doesn't make sense.

1149
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,626
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1150
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:34,630
No one knew we were here.
No one knew we were here, except...

1151
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:36,632
Doc.

1152
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:37,800
Oh, my God. Doc?

1153
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,929
Doc? Where is he?

1154
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:44,556
Doc?

1155
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:48,560
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1156
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,276
No.

1157
01:09:57,069 --> 01:09:58,696
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1158
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,864
You sold me out?

1159
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,992
Too many people offering me
too much money.

1160
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,205
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

1161
01:10:09,164 --> 01:10:10,290
A really nice one.

1162
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:11,750
But, Doc,

1163
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,961
it's me.

1164
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,296
It's just business.

1165
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:46,535
<i>This next bit
ain't very pretty.</i>

1166
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,705
- You're right.
- Harley?

1167
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,498
He's right.

1168
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,335
Business is business.

1169
01:10:56,462 --> 01:10:58,255
I've got the kid.

1170
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:01,717
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1171
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:03,594
If I hand her over,

1172
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:06,138
I want everyone who's after me
to back off.

1173
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:09,558
<i>Quinn,
bring me the rock now</i>

1174
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,477
<i>and I guarantee your safety.</i>

1175
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:15,189
<i>I own this town.
You'll have my protection.</i>

1176
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,815
Fine.

1177
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:21,111
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1178
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,080
Quit judging.

1179
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,376
Zsasz!

1180
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,468
Come on, kid.

1181
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,553
Let's get you somewhere safe.

1182
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,222
We got them.

1183
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:53,227
Little bird!

1184
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,855
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1185
01:11:57,523 --> 01:12:01,235
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1186
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,362
Do we have to bring them back?

1187
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:07,449
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

1188
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,494
Just bring me back my diamond.

1189
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:58,750
What is it?

1190
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,211
Nothing.

1191
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:15,726
Pull over.

1192
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:17,060
What?

1193
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,813
Pull the fucking car over now.

1194
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,067
I gotta take a leak.

1195
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:30,073
<i>She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.</i>

1196
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,658
Are you sure?

1197
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:34,494
<i>Your little bird's a fucking rat.</i>

1198
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,754
<i>You want me to kill her?</i>

1199
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:48,175
No.

1200
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:50,093
No. No.

1201
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,346
I'll come to you.

1202
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,550
I thought we were friends. And you...

1203
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:34,012
You saw what it's like for me out there.
I didn't have a choice.

1204
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:37,349
And if you go before he gets here,
everything will be fine.

1205
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,644
Harley.

1206
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:43,522
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1207
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:55,075
That was fast.

1208
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,371
She's in...

1209
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:01,540
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1210
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:04,042
You? Again?

1211
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:14,386
Are you drunk?

1212
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:15,846
Come on.

1213
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:17,139
Okay.

1214
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:40,829
Right in the tit.

1215
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:48,920
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1216
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,131
Cass.

1217
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,432
You killed my sandwich!

1218
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:09,024
Bye-bye, birdie.

1219
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,610
Ow!

1220
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:14,821
No fair.

1221
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,782
Was that really necessary?

1222
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,867
You don't know her like I do.

1223
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:20,577
Cass?

1224
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,041
Oh, thank God.

1225
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,369
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1226
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,836
Did she really tape you

1227
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,421
- to a damn toilet?
- Mmm-hmm.

1228
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:34,257
Hmm.

1229
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:35,884
This is nice.

1230
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:38,470
You're still conscious.

1231
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,099
You can still feel?

1232
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:45,227
Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

1233
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:51,108
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

1234
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:03,495
I got one

1235
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:09,334
for all the little birds
I helped fly away from this world.

1236
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,379
I'm saving a special spot for you.

1237
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,215
Right here.

1238
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:21,447
You're gonna have to be quiet.

1239
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:22,597
- Ow!
- Hi.

1240
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:24,099
What are you guys doing?

1241
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,856
Oh, I know where the diamond is.

1242
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:34,276
Is that rock still inside you?

1243
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,822
Oh, God.

1244
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:42,993
Stop.

1245
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,538
The hell, Zsasz?

1246
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:48,623
Cut her open.

1247
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,000
Stop fucking around.

1248
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,209
You heard me.

1249
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,003
Cut her fucking open.

1250
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:56,798
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

1251
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:59,384
You're a filthy fucking rat.

1252
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:00,677
I'm a rat?

1253
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:04,389
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1254
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:06,516
You little fucking bird.

1255
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,769
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1256
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,733
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1257
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,987
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1258
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:20,906
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1259
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,115
Prove it to me.

1260
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,744
Rip open her little tummy.

1261
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,204
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1262
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,539
Now! Rip it open!

1263
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:45,305
You piece of shit!

1264
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,689
Freeze!

1265
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,070
Don't fucking move.

1266
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,115
Who the fuck are you?

1267
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,332
Go get the kid.

1268
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,917
All right.

1269
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:16,086
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1270
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,564
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1271
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,799
Shoot them, kid.

1272
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:24,719
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1273
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,639
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1274
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:28,807
Okay.

1275
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:31,726
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1276
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,353
But I know that this shit stick...

1277
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,898
...just tried to gut me.

1278
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:38,900
And you.

1279
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:42,779
Thought you were different.

1280
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,992
I'm sorry, kid.

1281
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:52,122
I'm just a terrible person, I guess.

1282
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:00,088
Ooh!

1283
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:02,007
Ooh, I'm back.

1284
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:05,760
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

1285
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:08,239
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1286
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:11,266
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1287
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,851
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1288
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,647
I'm not letting you sell the kid to him.

1289
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:20,817
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

1290
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,652
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin. Huh?

1291
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,739
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

1292
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,699
Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.

1293
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,492
I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1294
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,618
Whoa.

1295
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:33,580
They call me...

1296
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:34,748
Helena Bertinelli.

1297
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,291
For fuck's sake.

1298
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,460
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1299
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:42,380
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1300
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:49,846
<i>I killed Galante.</i>

1301
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:55,643
I killed his firing squad.

1302
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,859
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

1303
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:10,367
And now I'm done.

1304
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,286
Bravo.

1305
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,293
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1306
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:21,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1307
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,799
I hate to be the one to break it to you,
sweetheart, but you are not done.

1308
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:29,010
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

1309
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:31,054
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1310
01:21:31,221 --> 01:21:33,556
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

1311
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,850
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1312
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:39,104
That diamond is our only chance
of stopping him.

1313
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,271
You guys.

1314
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,774
Hey, I think you should see this.

1315
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:46,444
Oh.

1316
01:21:46,528 --> 01:21:48,113
It's Sionis.

1317
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:02,168
We're fucked.

1318
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:04,712
He bought himself an army.

1319
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:14,556
They're all here for me.

1320
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,184
Aren't they?

1321
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:26,609
- No.
- They're not?

1322
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:28,027
No, they're not.

1323
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:30,363
Do you know what that means?

1324
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,341
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1325
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,575
He's after all of us.

1326
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:36,244
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1327
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,831
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1328
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,834
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

1329
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:46,254
So, unless we all wanna die
very unpleasant deaths

1330
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:49,632
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1331
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,619
we're gonna have to work together.

1332
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:55,013
With you?

1333
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,222
Yeah.

1334
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:57,908
We're gonna work together,

1335
01:22:57,932 --> 01:22:59,652
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1336
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:04,981
Okay.

1337
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:08,443
Yeah. Okay.

1338
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:12,405
Sure.

1339
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:13,948
Yes!

1340
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,242
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1341
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:17,327
Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,750
Will this do?

1343
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:26,336
No.

1344
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:28,129
Not at all.

1345
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,175
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1346
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:34,093
That slimy jizznozzle!

1347
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,620
- I can't believe he took it all!
- We're fucked.

1348
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,848
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1349
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:46,356
Okay.

1350
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:02,539
Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.

1351
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:07,585
I have funded you. I've protected you.

1352
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:11,881
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1353
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,009
Well, now it's time to say thank you.

1354
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:21,975
Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

1355
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:25,895
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1356
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:27,897
The rest you can kill.

1357
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:35,238
Dope.

1358
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,700
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.

1359
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:40,868
Sentimental value. Try this.

1360
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:45,456
- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

1361
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:48,084
Isn't this fun? It's just
like a sleepover.

1362
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,503
We should order pizza. Make cosmos.

1363
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,547
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1364
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:56,467
Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1365
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:59,637
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

1366
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,615
I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

1367
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:03,099
I don't have rage issues.

1368
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:05,977
You know, psychologically speaking,

1369
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,605
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1370
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:09,689
Yeah.

1371
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:12,442
Are we ready? Bad guys, just outside.

1372
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:18,156
Shit. Get down.

1373
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:21,117
Down here!

1374
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:23,995
Cass!

1375
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:26,372
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1376
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:27,617
Go!

1377
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:33,671
Holy shit!

1378
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:55,943
What?

1379
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:57,737
You are so cool.

1380
01:25:58,321 --> 01:25:59,656
Okay. This way.

1381
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:10,041
Get ready, ladies.

1382
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,112
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.

1383
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:23,638
Okay? Okay.

1384
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:26,224
What the... Go! Go, go, go!

1385
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,101
Fuck.

1386
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,521
Shit.

1387
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:42,824
Whoa. Shit!

1388
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,511
Motherfucker.

1389
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,860
Let me go!

1390
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:20,528
Gotcha.

1391
01:27:21,738 --> 01:27:22,739
This way!

1392
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,449
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.

1393
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:26,159
You shouldn't have to see this.

1394
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:28,327
Here, hold on to this for me, okay?

1395
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:29,555
That's all you think about.

1396
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,140
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1397
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,500
Here. Get down. Come on. You'll be safe.

1398
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:17,710
Canary!

1399
01:28:19,337 --> 01:28:20,505
You okay?

1400
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:22,799
We gotta go this way!

1401
01:28:25,218 --> 01:28:26,219
Ugh. More?

1402
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:28,634
When the fuck did she have time
to do a shoe change?

1403
01:28:28,763 --> 01:28:29,764
Come on.

1404
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:37,980
Thanks.

1405
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:52,578
Duck!

1406
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,125
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1407
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:00,336
Ah, fuck!

1408
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:06,551
I got him!

1409
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,264
Get back here, kid!

1410
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:16,519
Who's got the kid?

1411
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:30,324
Get down!

1412
01:29:40,835 --> 01:29:43,462
Please, no more.

1413
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:49,510
So, forgive me yet?

1414
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:50,761
Get off me.

1415
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,935
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1416
01:29:58,102 --> 01:29:59,302
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1417
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:00,479
Really?

1418
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:10,716
Down! Get down!

1419
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,366
You're okay.
You're okay.

1420
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:14,785
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1421
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:18,372
Get off!

1422
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:20,017
I got you.

1423
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,042
Ooh!

1424
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:24,211
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1425
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:27,256
Harley! No! Get off me!

1426
01:30:27,423 --> 01:30:28,423
Harley!

1427
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,134
They got the kid. Shit!

1428
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:33,429
We can't let them get her. I trust you.

1429
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,390
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1430
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:37,850
Has anyone got any bullets?

1431
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,602
Fuck. I'm out.

1432
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,855
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1433
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:45,358
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Shit.

1434
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,276
Guys, they're in the car.

1435
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,129
They're getting away.

1436
01:30:49,153 --> 01:30:50,571
- Get in there!
- Get off!

1437
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,159
Shit! I'm out.

1438
01:30:55,326 --> 01:30:57,006
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1439
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,123
Canary, you know what you have to do!

1440
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:04,460
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1441
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:26,857
<i>Told ya she had
a killer voice.</i>

1442
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:49,296
Need a ride?

1443
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:16,323
Get her!

1444
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,231
Oh!

1445
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:01,035
Whip me!

1446
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,161
What?

1447
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:03,496
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1448
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:12,546
Kid!

1449
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:14,256
Harley!

1450
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:16,425
Shoot her!

1451
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,018
Harley!

1452
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:28,559
Hit the brakes!

1453
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:48,983
No!

1454
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:03,305
Uh-oh.

1455
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:31,458
Kid!

1456
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:44,930
Harley!

1457
01:35:02,907 --> 01:35:05,784
Well, we always did share
a love of the dramatic.

1458
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:06,952
Didn't we?

1459
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:10,956
And look at us now.

1460
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,044
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1461
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:17,504
I'm the only one who can protect you!

1462
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:22,843
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1463
01:35:22,927 --> 01:35:24,136
You're not the type!

1464
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:28,307
But me? You need me!

1465
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:46,033
Here's the thing, Romy baby.

1466
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,789
Your protection is based on the fact
that people are scared of you.

1467
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:54,416
Just like they're scared of Mr. J.

1468
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:02,424
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1469
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,261
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1470
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:08,347
'Cause I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1471
01:36:16,105 --> 01:36:17,189
Shit.

1472
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:20,526
That was super embarrassing.

1473
01:36:20,651 --> 01:36:22,278
Hmm. Sure was.

1474
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,948
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1475
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,201
I'm sorry, kid.

1476
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,247
And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.

1477
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:36,542
For what it's worth,

1478
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:41,171
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1479
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:43,340
Ew.

1480
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:46,844
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1481
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:48,304
Excuse me!

1482
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,806
I stole something from you.

1483
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,891
You slippery-fingered little turd.

1484
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:54,268
I took your ring.

1485
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:55,811
My ring?

1486
01:36:58,647 --> 01:36:59,648
Dope.

1487
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,253
Cass! Harley!

1488
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:23,088
We're okay.

1489
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:28,302
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1490
01:37:29,303 --> 01:37:31,180
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1491
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:33,098
Good. Fuck that guy.

1492
01:37:33,265 --> 01:37:34,975
Yeah. Tacos?

1493
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:37,561
No, but seriously.

1494
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:39,521
You were very impressive with that bow.

1495
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:40,856
Very impressive.

1496
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:42,000
It's a crossbow.

1497
01:37:42,024 --> 01:37:43,084
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1498
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:44,669
- Mmm-hmm.
- Morning margaritas!

1499
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:45,879
Thank you. I got you.

1500
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:47,237
- You drink, right, kid?
- Yeah.

1501
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:48,614
I don't think so.

1502
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:50,783
And I love that fucking name, Huntress.

1503
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:52,368
- Really?
- Yeah.

1504
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:53,827
Oh, great name.

1505
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:55,162
Wow.

1506
01:37:55,537 --> 01:38:00,167
Um... I really like how you were able
to kick so high in those tight pants.

1507
01:38:00,334 --> 01:38:01,811
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Yeah.

1508
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:03,115
- Thanks.
- Oh, um...

1509
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:05,923
Thanks for the car.

1510
01:38:07,508 --> 01:38:08,842
You're welcome.

1511
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:11,220
Kid, if that burrito
doesn't make you shit,

1512
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:13,097
I don't know what will.

1513
01:38:15,057 --> 01:38:16,100
Give me a minute.

1514
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:18,810
Yes!

1515
01:38:19,103 --> 01:38:20,896
Right.

1516
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:24,650
I've given her prune juice, laxatives.

1517
01:38:24,817 --> 01:38:26,860
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1518
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:29,113
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1519
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:30,864
Me?

1520
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:34,868
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1521
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:37,579
I'm used to it.

1522
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:41,291
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1523
01:38:43,377 --> 01:38:44,378
Ladies.

1524
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:46,171
Have fun with that.

1525
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:49,591
So, what now?

1526
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:51,677
Sionis is gone, but it's just

1527
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,595
a matter of time
before some other asshole

1528
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,042
tries to finish what he started.

1529
01:38:55,097 --> 01:38:56,098
Right.

1530
01:38:56,265 --> 01:38:59,017
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1531
01:39:00,102 --> 01:39:02,271
Does she always talk like
the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1532
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:03,674
or is that just me?

1533
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:04,773
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

1534
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,066
What?

1535
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:08,277
I mean, we were amazing there.

1536
01:39:08,444 --> 01:39:09,987
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1537
01:39:10,154 --> 01:39:13,157
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1538
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:14,324
Thank you.

1539
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,570
Right.

1540
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:16,618
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1541
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:20,539
She stole my fucking car!

1542
01:39:20,706 --> 01:39:21,707
What?

1543
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:26,879
I'm sorry.

<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

1545

You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1546
01:39:31,175 --> 01:39:34,636
But you heard what the cop said.
Sionis is gone.

1547
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:39,600
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1548

<i>Montoya's boss picked up</i>

1549
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:43,896
<i>the gangbangers
at the Booby Trap.</i>

1550
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:46,982
<i>And took all the credit
while he was at it.</i>

1551

<i>Again.</i>

1552
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,616
<i>It was the kick in the balls
she needed</i>

1553
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:59,244
<i>to see that she had nothing to prove
to those blowhard assholes.</i>

1554
01:40:00,204 --> 01:40:02,206
<i>She quit the same day.</i>

1555
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,338
<i>We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</i>

1556
01:40:09,505 --> 01:40:11,798
<i>And Huntress got her family money back.</i>

1557
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:15,928
<i>She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.</i>

a chunk of change, so I pawned it.</i>

1561

<i>And if you get too close
I might snatch off your chain</i>
