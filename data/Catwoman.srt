6
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,652

7
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,029
<i>...because the day that I died...</i>

8
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:01,242

9

10
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,590

11
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,885

12

- Happily.

19

- I don't know how you get it.

Beau-line.

28

My husband...

33

it's time for me to step aside...

It has been a magnificent 15 years.

36
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,589
But we have decided to choose
a new face to represent Beau-line.

37
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,216
Exactly.

38
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,426
Drina.

39
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,012
The future of Hedare Beauty.

00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,433

I look forward...

- Allergies?

310
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,343

00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,114
Sally?

315
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,241
Sally! Sally?

316
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,578
Hey.

317
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,791
Ever noticed when they keep you for
observation no one really observes you?

318
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,044
- Did they tell you what was wrong?
- Oh, they have no idea.

319
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,131
They did run a million fun tests, though.

320
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,383
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.

321
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,635
I can see you're feeling better.

322
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,139
Reminds me, what's up with
the "hot yet modest, but who cares...

...because he's so hot" detective?

324
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,769
It's not gonna work out, Sal.

325
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:01,105
Patience, you never think
it's gonna work.

326
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:06,277
Because it doesn't. I've got a good
reason for saying it this time. Trust me.

327
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,488
Look, this time I refuse
to let you sabotage a good thing.

328
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,657
If it's broke, fix it.

329
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,911
All right? Now, I love you,
and he is gonna love you. Now, go.

330
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,247
Go give him some brown sugar.

331
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,167
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.

332
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,835
Tell me I look vulnerable.

333
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,007
Being good is something you keep
in your heart because you put it there.

334
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,677
I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying
some people don't choose to be bad.

335
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,014
But I want something different for you.
I want something better.

336
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,600
- You understand?
- Yeah.

337
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,645

- No. You know what makes somebody--

You never got your coffee.

345
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:23,687
Well, you're a brave man to be facing
a mob like this. No backup?

346
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,065
I'm used to working alone,
most of the time.

347
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,525
- Is that by choice, or--
- Yeah, theirs.

348
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:33,030
No, I've had partners before.
Turns out I take my job too seriously.

00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,824
You know my friend Sally?
That's what she says about me.

350
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,702
She says that I'm fun-deficient.

351
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,038
- I don't believe that.
- That's what she says.

he'll be at the factory the rest of the day.

you mean the Four Seasons...

I'm sitting here in a paper dress,
for God's sakes.

All we did was talk.
And play a little one-on-one.

It just happened.

really weird is happening to me.

- Next time? He asked you out again?

396
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:40,068
<i>- I love this guy.</i>
- So do I. But it's me I'm worried about.

397
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:44,656
- I felt like I couldn't be myself.
- Well, feel free to be me next time.

A goddess of the moon, and of the sun.

- But you were reborn.
- Oh, you're crazy.

459
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:19,207
- You are a crazy cat lady.
- Midnight knew your fate.

460
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,795
That's why she tested you.

461
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,050
To see if you were worthy
of a gift she could give you.

462
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,554
A gift that could change your life...

463
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,889
...and give you a new one.

464
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:46,651
You're not alone, child.
He's saved others before you. Look.

465
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:55,535
Catwomen are not contained
by the rules of society.

466
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,122
You follow your own desires.

467
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,750
This is both a blessing and a curse.

468
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:06,629
You will often be alone
and misunderstood.

469
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:11,092
But you will experience a freedom
other women will never know.

470
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:16,097
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...

471
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,517
...every sound, incredibly heightened.

472
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:25,648
Fierce independence, total confidence,
inhuman reflexes.

473
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:30,486
- So I'm not Patience anymore?
- You are Patience.

474
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,198
And you are Catwoman.

475
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:45,752
Accept it, child.

476
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,755
You've spent a lifetime caged.

477
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:53,509
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

478
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,931
...you can be free.
And freedom is power.

479
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,247
You saved my life, Midnight.

480
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,415
But somebody killed me...

481
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:29,045
...and I've got to find out who, and why.

She heard something
she wasn't supposed to hear.

So are you gonna be okay, or what?

Some chick in a cat suit
murdered Slavicky last night.

<i>The actions of this lunatic will not

- I'm almost out.
- Let's see.

00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,162
How long have you
been having headaches?

527
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,206
- About a month.
- Do me a favor.

528

- Stop using this.
- Why?

Hey, Bob, let me ask you a question.

534
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,651
Would your wife crawl out on the ledge
of a building to rescue a cat?

535
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,112
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

536
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:49,253
<font color="#ffff80">MAN:</font>
Well, there are similarities.

537
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:53,591
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
- Were they written by the same person?

538
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:56,177
Well, it's not an exact science.

539
00:59:56,427 --> 01:00:00,848
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the letters? Indicative of loneliness.

540
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:05,060
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

541
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,772
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.

542
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,441
Very self-confident, almost angry.

543
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:13,944
And the O, well, this person
doesn't like to play by the rules.

544
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,113
- So they're different people.
- Very.

545
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,241
If you put these two women
in the same room...

546

You work for Hedare, right?

have a grudge against the company?

Lots of people. George Hedare isn't
the nicest guy in the world, you know.

558
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:07,498

761
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:37,727
I'm telling you, Slavicky had evidence
that Beau-line was toxic.

762
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:39,645
That's why Laurel killed him.

763
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:43,399
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.

764
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,236
Ballistics show the same weapon killed
both men: the gun in your hand.

765
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,615
- Catwoman's hand.
- What's the difference?

766
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,828
- Guess it doesn't matter.
- Don't you understand?

767
01:21:56,412 --> 01:22:00,416
All of the evidence, every single piece,
it points to you.

768
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,086
There's nothing that shows me
anything else.

769
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:05,755
There's me.

770
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:08,549
You can believe me.

771
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,267

you saw me?

01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:24,440

...rescuing a cat.

776
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,444
No, you didn't.

777
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:33,449
You saw a crazy person out on a ledge
trying to jump.

778
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,831
And all the evidence pointed to that,
didn't it?

779
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:43,292
