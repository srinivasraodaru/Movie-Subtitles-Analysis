1
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,260
A famous man once said,

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,097
"We create our own demons."

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,642
Who said that?
What does that even mean?

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,602
It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,312
So, now, he was famous

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,898
and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.

7
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,608
I don't...

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,819
I'm going to start again.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,489
Let's track this from the beginning.

10
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,861
Half hour till the ball drops.

11
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,196
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,531
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

13
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,408
I gave a speech? How was it?

14
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,076
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,911
Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

16
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,788
- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,914
Probably back in your room

18
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,124
because I also want
to see your research.

19
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,208
Okay, you can see my research,

20
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,252
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

21
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,545
Mr. Stark.

22
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:26,588
Ho Yinsen.

23
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,673
I finally met a man called "Ho."

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,093
I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr. Wu.

25
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,636
- Oh, this guy.
- Mr. Stark.

26
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:38,057
You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...

27
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,771
Perhaps another time?

28
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,192
It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.

29
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,361
- The old days.
- Mr. Stark!

30
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,822
I never thought they would
come back to bite me.

31
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,907
Why would they?

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,700
Wow! Hey, Tony!

33
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,370
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

34
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,622
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

35
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,249
Of course, but Ms. Hansen,

36
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,753
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,921
Yeah, we're full.

38
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,381
Wow, he made it. He made the cut.

39
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,633
What floor you going to, pal?

40
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,218
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

41
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,385
The ground floor, actually,

42
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,471
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

43
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,391
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

44
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:24,395
She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.

45
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,149
"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,651
I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.

47
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,404
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

48
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,198
Thank you, I'll call you.

49
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,119
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

50
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,454
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

51
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,248
I'll see you up
on the roof in 5 minutes.

52
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,874
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

53
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,042
You know what I'm talking about?

54
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,126
I'll see you up there.

55
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,586
Damn betcha.

56
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,339
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

57
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,715
Well, it was.

58
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,509
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,593
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

60
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,011
...and chemically recode it.

61
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,514
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

62
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,682
...operating system...

63
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,141
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.

64
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,518
- Yes.
- Wow.

65
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,644
Is that...
Can you...

66
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,229
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

67
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,022
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

68
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,108
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

69
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,235
- Happy...
- That's cute...

70
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,778
Leave her ficus alone.

71
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,904
Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.

72
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,115
- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.

73
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,450
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

74
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,161
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

75
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,454
Exactly, exactly.

76
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,582
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

77
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,041
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

78
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,585
...even limb regrowth.

79
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,462
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

80
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,797
Wow.

81
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,425
- In Switzerland.
- That's better.

82
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,552
- You're seeing things.
- This week.

83
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,679
You almost bought it, didn't you?

84
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,317
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,693
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,861
- The what?
- Down!

87
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,322
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

88
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,948
- We're good.
- Stay down.

89
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,159
You're right on me. I made it.

90
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,828
What the hell was that?

91
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,789
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

92
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,458
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

93
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,667
It's not Y2K.

94
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,502
Hey! Happy New Year!

95
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,837
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

96
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,297
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

97
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,423
- You good?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,467
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

99
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,905
So, why am I telling you this?

100
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,784
Because I had just created demons

101
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,370
and I didn't even know it.

102
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,749
Yeah, those were good times.

103
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,460
Then I moved on.

104
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,213
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.

105
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,216
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

106
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,302
- These days, I'm a changed man.
- 46.

107
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,763
I'm different now.

108
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,014
I'm... Well...

109
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,600
- 47.
- You know who I am.

110
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,603
Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...

111
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,105
No. 48.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,151
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

113
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,236
As you wish, sir.

114
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:21,364
I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.

115
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,074
Which I will.

116
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,659
All right, let's do this.

117
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,703
DUM-E.

118
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:27,787
Hi, DUM-E.

119
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,206
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

120
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,208
Hey. Hey!

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,712
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

122
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,089
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

123
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,176
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?

124
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,012
Focus up, ladies.

125
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,931
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

126
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,392
I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival

127
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,437
of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.

128
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,480
Start tight and then go wide.

129
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,024
Stamp date and time.

130
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,193
Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

131
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,112
lnitialise sequence.

132
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,491
Jarvis, drop my needle.

133
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,975
Crap.

134
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,787
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

135
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,671
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

136
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,798
Slow it down just a...

137
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,174
...little bit.

138
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,517
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

139
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,613
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

140
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,247
I'm the best.

141
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,840
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

142
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,802
I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.

143
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,888
I didn't think it could get any worse.

144
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,268
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.

145
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,606
That's when he happened.

146
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,534
Some people call me a terrorist.

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,914
I consider myself a teacher.

148
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,751
America.

149
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,047
Ready for another lesson?

150
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:30,344
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited

151
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,681
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.

152
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:38,060
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind

153
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,439
and claim their land.

154
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,399
39 hours ago,

155
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:48,362
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.

156
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,698
I... I... I did that.

157
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,116
A quaint military church

158
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,661
filled with wives and children,
of course.

159
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,708
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.

160
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,045
The braves were away.

161
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,589
President Ellis.

162
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,051
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.

163
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
And now you've missed me again.

164
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,808
You know who I am.

165
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,977
You don't know where I am.

166
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,981
And you'll never see me coming.

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,611
Now that we seem to be back,

168
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,196
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...

169
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,156
American airwaves were hijacked...

170
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,824
The nation remains on high alert.

171
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,535
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.

172
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,997
Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event

173
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,208
is a newly minted resource.

174
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,544
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.

175
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,797
The American people
will soon know him

176
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,507
as the Iron Patriot.

177
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,468
And how is President Ellis responding?

178
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,720
By taking the guy
they call War Machine

179
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,430
and giving him a paint job.

180
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,184
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.

181
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:04,146
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "lron Patriot."

182
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,149
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.

183
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,318
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

184
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,112
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.

185
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,613
"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.

186
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,115
All right?
This sends a better message.

187
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,537
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

188
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,040
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

189
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,671
It's classified information, Tony.

190
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,257
Okay, there have been 9 bombings.

191
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,551
- 9.
- The public only knows about 3.

192
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,721
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

193
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,930
There's no bomb casings.

194
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,308
You know I can help. Just ask.

195
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,101
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

196
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,563
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.

197
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,148
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

198
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,900
Einstein slept 3 hours a year.
Look what he did.

199
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,403
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

200
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,738
You're going to come at me like that?

201
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,448
I'm not trying to be a dick...

202
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,158
...tator.

203
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,743
Do you mind signing my drawing?

204
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,403
If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?

205
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,872
Yeah. Fine with me.

206
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,334
- What's your name?
- Erin.

207
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,421
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.

208
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,090
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

209
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:16,010
After New York, aliens... Come on.

210
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,762
They need to look strong.

211
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,015
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

212
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,892
- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

213
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,518
- I get it.
- It's American business.

214
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,437
That's why I said I got it.

215
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,606
Are you okay?

216
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,316
I broke the crayon.

217
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,109
Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

218
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,028
Take it easy. Tony.

219
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,198
How did you get out of the Wormhole?

220
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:38,949
Wait a minute. Tony!

221
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,076
- What did you say?
- Tony.

222
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,745
Sorry.

223
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,372
I'm just checking on the suit.

224
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,457
Okay.

225
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,128
Check the heart.

226
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,630
Is it the brain?

227
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,633
No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.

228
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,551
Okay, so I was poisoned?

229
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,973
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.

230
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,602
Me?

231
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,771
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

232
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,940
Sorry, I gotta split.

233
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,276
Badge.

234
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,736
Badge.

235
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,197
Come on, badge.

236
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,118
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

237
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,495
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

238
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,664
This is an asset that we can put to use.

239
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,793
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

240
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,461
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

241
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,631
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

242
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,050
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

243
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,593
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

244
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,970
- You should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

245
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,638
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

246
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,433
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?

247
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,226
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,853
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

249
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,855
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

250
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,442
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

251
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,609
Thank you.

252
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,236
It's not a compliment.

253
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,571
It's not...
It is a compliment.

254
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,197
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

255
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,490
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

256
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,534
Ms. Potts, your 4:00 is here.

257
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,035
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

258
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,912
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

259
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,373
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

260
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,833
How so?

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,335
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

262
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,545
so it's a little awkward.

263
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,464
I don't like the sound of that.

264
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,470
Pepper

265
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,430
Killian?

266
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,265
You look great.

267
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,975
You look really great.

268
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,311
God, you look great.

269
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,604
I... I... I.-

270
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,439
What on earth have you been doing?

271
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:34,899
Nothing fancy.

272
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,276
Just 5 years in the hands
of physical therapists.

273
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,320
And please, call me Aldrich.

274
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,872
You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

275
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:44,116
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

276
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,744
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

277
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,537
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

278
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,832
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

279
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,548
Hey, guy-

280
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,224
Merry Christmas.

281
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:13,562
After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,

282
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:14,980
my think tank

283
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,109
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

284
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:24,073
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

285
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,325
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

286
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,121
Regard the human brain.

287
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,504
Wait, hold on, hold on.

288
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,548
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

289
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,508
But if I do that...

290
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,139
That's the brain.

291
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,642
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

292
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,060
Wow, that's amazing.

293
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,812
Thanks, it's mine.

294
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,146
What?

295
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,107
This. You're inside my head.

296
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,276
It's a...
It's a live feed.

297
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,194
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

298
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:04,989
Come on.

299
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:08,993
Now, pinch my arm.

300
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,162
I can take it. Pinch me.

301
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,582
What is that?

302
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,002
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

303
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,589
But this is what I wanted to show you.

304
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,345
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

305
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,348
and it goes here.

306
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,643
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

307
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,520
is that our mind,

308
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,105
our entire DNA, in fact,

309
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,107
is destined to be upgraded.

310
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,358
Wow.

311
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,153
Wait...

312
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,410
Hello?

313
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,370
- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?

314
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,205
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

315
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,582
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

316
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:57,791
What, harassing interns?

317
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,168
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened

318
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,252
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

319
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,296
They would laugh in my face.

320
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,757
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.

321
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,675
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.

322
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,552
What's going on? Fill me in.

323
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,845
- For real?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,513
All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.

325
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,223
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Right.

326
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,726
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.

327
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,810
- Yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,228
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.

329
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,856
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...

330
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,567
Where were we in '99?
The science conference?

331
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,195
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

332
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,780
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

333
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,365
Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

334
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,075
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.

335
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,328
But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

336
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,163
- His what?
- Big brain.

337
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,665
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.

338
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,875
Hold on. See?

339
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,460
Look at what? You, watching them?

340
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,545
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.

341
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,465
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

342
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,300
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

343
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,593
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

344
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,429
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.

345
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,931
All right?
I don't work for you.

346
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,642
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.

347
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,768
He's shifty.

348
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,852
- Relax.
- Seriously?

349
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,437
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

350
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,855
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

351
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,607
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

352
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,442
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

353
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,944
and you're just ignoring her.

354
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,112
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

355
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,530
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

356
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,157
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

357
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,784
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

358
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,619
I miss you, Happy-

359
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,788
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

360
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,123
Now you're off with the super-friends.

361
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,416
I don't know what's going on
with you any more.

362
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,542
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!

363
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,626
I hate to cut you off.

364
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,711
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?

365
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,004
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

366
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,173
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

367
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,550
Yeah, nice.

368
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,471
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

369
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,598
and recode its DNA.

370
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,684
That would be incredible.

371
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,479
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

372
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,233
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,985
Tony, Tony-

374
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,782
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

375
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,908
He turned me down.

376
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,455
But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne

377
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,791
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony anymore

378
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,835
and who has slightly less of an ego.

379
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,922
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

380
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,384
As much as I'd like to help you.

381
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,014
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

382
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,807
But then, as my father used to say,

383
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,643
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

384
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,187
That's very deep.

385
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,688
And I have no idea what it means.

386
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,650
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

387
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,695
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

388
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,456
Happy-

389
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,626
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

390
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,463
Yes, I just...

391
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,966
God, I forgot my other things, so...

392
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,177
I'm just gonna...

393
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,914
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

394
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,374
What the...
What is that?

395
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,961
You're wearing this in the house now?

396
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,629
What is that, like, Mark 15?

397
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,508
Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

398
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,802
And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

399
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,595
Just breaking it in.

400
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,807
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...

401
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,059
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

402
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,477
Yes, I did. I...

403
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,063
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

404
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,190
Is it gonna fit through the door?

405
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,608
Well, actually, it's a good question.

406
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,236
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

407
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,779
- Okay.
- So...

408
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,531
Tense? Good day? Huh?

409
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,284
Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

410
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,954
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

411
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,163
Did I like it?

412
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,999
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

413
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,877
I appreciate the thought very much.

414
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,548
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

415
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,344
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

416
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,307
You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?

417
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,392
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

418
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,061
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to Jimmy that thing open?

419
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,813
Crowbar, yeah.

420
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,232
Except there's been a radiation leak.

421
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,234
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

422
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,446
At least, let me get you, like,
a hazmat suit.

423
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,908
A Geiger counter or something like that.

424
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,118
Busted.

425
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,788
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

426
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,333
You ate without me already?
On date night?

427
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,418
- He was just...
- You mean you.

428
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,171
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...

429
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,174
...while I finished up a little work.

430
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,550
And yes, I had a quick bite.

431
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,593
I didn't know if you were coming home

432
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,428
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

433
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,558
- What?
- What?

434
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,227
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

435
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,312
Happy was concerned.

436
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,521
- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

437
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,731
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

438
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,275
Come on. Pep?

439
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey, I admit it.

440
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,488
My fault. Sorry.

441
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,699
I'm a piping hot mess.

442
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,871
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

443
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,457
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

444
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,003
Really? I didn't notice that at all.

445
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,673
You experience things

446
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,383
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

447
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:44,638
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

448
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,098
The only reason I haven't cracked up

449
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,141
is probably because you moved in.

450
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,643
Which is great.

451
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,269
I love you. I'm lucky.

452
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,314
But honey, I can't sleep.

453
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,735
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

454
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,570
I tinker. I....

455
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,490
Threat is imminent.

456
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,202
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

457
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,996
That's you.

458
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,331
And my suits, they're...

459
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,416
Machines.

460
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,251
They're part of me.

461
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,503
A distraction.

462
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,672
Maybe.

463
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,358
I'm gonna take a shower.

464
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,152
Okay.

465
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,613
And you're gonna join me.

466
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,742
Better.

467
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,511
Tony.

468
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,639
Tony. Tony.

469
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,100
To...

470
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,521
Power down!

471
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,323
I must have called it in my sleep.

472
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,700
That's not supposed to happen.

473
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,205
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

474
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,085
Can we just... Just let me...

475
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,587
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

476
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,798
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

477
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,133
Tinker with that.

478
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,828
Can you regulate?

479
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:13,954
Yes, I can regulate.

480
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,163
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

481
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,134
It's a decent batch.

482
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,554
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

483
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,142
I mean, for understanding.

484
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
I'm sorry, buddy.

485
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,127
What are you doing, buddy?

486
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,545
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

487
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,713
Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?

488
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,007
Yeah, a little movie
called The Party's Over,

489
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,967
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

490
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,051
Here's the ticket.

491
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,429
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

492
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,956
Savin!

493
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,125
Help!

494
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,002
Help me!

495
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,173
True story about fortune cookies.

496
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,591
They look Chinese.

497
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,553
They sound Chinese.

498
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,765
But they're actually
an American invention.

499
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:25,645
Which is why they're hollow,
full of lies

500
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,897
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

501
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:33,737
My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knockoff.

502
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,115
The Chinese Theatre.

503
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,701
Mr. President,

504
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,078
I know this must be getting frustrating.

505
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:47,500
But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.

506
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,588
And don't worry, the big one is coming.

507
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,048
Your graduation.

508
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,855
Hi.

509
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:10,815
Do you mind leaving that on?

510
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,692
Sure.

511
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:23,119
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.

512
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,831
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

513
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,544
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

514
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:32,837
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

515
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:36,049
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

516
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,176
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

517
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,803
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

518
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,513
His reaction
to the latest attack.

519
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,182
Mr. Stark, hi there.

520
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:47,519
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

521
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,729
Anything else you can tell us?

522
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
Hey, Mr. Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

523
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,651
I'm just saying.

524
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,781
Is that what you want?

525
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,660
Here's a little holiday greeting

526
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,162
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

527
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,623
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

528
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:12,377
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

529
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,505
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

530
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,841
that you just died, pal.

531
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,051
I'm gonna come get the body.

532
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,887
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

533
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,182
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

534
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:30,103
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

535
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,690
10880 Malibu Point.

536
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,942
90265.

537
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,861
I'll leave the door unlocked.

538
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:38,945
That's what you wanted, right?

539
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,033
Bill me.

540
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,458
I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,

541
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:55,753
drawn from
S.H.l.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.

542
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,381
Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.

543
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,345
Okay. What have we got here?

544
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,766
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "adviser to the king."

545
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,145
South American insurgency tactics.

546
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,689
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

547
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:19,110
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

548
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,780
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.

549
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,493
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.

550
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,245
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

551
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,330
No, sir.

552
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,374
Talk to me, Happy.

553
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,020
When is a bomb not a bomb?

554
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,449
Any military victims?

555
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,077
Not according to public record, sir.

556
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,287
Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.

557
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,081
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

558
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,875
The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.

559
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,043
Accessing satellites

560
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,005
and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.

561
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,133
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

562
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,598
Nope.

563
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,731
That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?

564
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,276
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

565
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,195
The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.

566
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,114
Bring her around.

567
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:49,200
The heat signature
is remarkably similar.

568
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,327
3,000 degree Celsius.

569
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,206
That's 2 military guys.

570
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,166
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

571
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,169
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

572
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,260
Are we still at ding-dong?

573
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,762
We're supposed to be on total...

574
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:10,972
...security lockdown.

575
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,807
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

576
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,602
There's only so much I can do, sir,

577
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:19,606
when you give the world's press
your home address.

578
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,867
Right there is fine.

579
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,581
You're not the Mandarin.

580
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,750
Are you? Are you?

581
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,919
You don't remember.

582
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,129
Why am I not surprised?

583
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,465
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

584
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,008
Gluten-free waffles, sir.

585
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,384
That's right.

586
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,387
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

587
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,472
It's urgent.

588
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,770
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

589
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,896
It's...

590
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,732
- With her.
- Tony?

591
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,278
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

592
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,405
Old botanist pal

593
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,866
that I used to know, barely.

594
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,660
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

595
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,827
waiting in the car that I've never met.

596
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,912
He's 13.

597
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,789
No, I need your help.

598
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,457
But, what for? Why now?

599
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,794
Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

600
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:23,920
I'll be fine.

601
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,465
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

602
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,425
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

603
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,260
- She's not, really.
- No, not really.

604
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,514
- It was just one night.
- Yep.

605
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,307
That's how you did it, isn't it?

606
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,726
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

607
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,728
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

608
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,397
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

609
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,481
Okay. We've been through this.

610
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,607
- Nope.
- Yep!

611
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,609
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

612
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,236
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

613
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,947
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

614
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,532
This is how normal people behave.

615
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,784
I can't protect you out there.

616
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,703
Is... Is that normal?

617
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,955
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

618
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,707
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

619
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,041
Calm down.

620
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,043
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

621
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,461
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

622
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:06,838
I don't like it.

623
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,922
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

624
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,215
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

625
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,383
That's not even up for discussion.

626
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,677
- Can we...
- I said no. What?

627
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,970
Do we need to worry about that?

628
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,479
I got you.

629
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,731
I got you first.

630
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,149
Like I said, we can't stay here.

631
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,535
Move! I'm right behind you.

632
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,749
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

633
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,543
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

634
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,670
Go!

635
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,778
Oh, my God. Tony!

636
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,920
Sir, Ms. Potts
is clear of the structure.

637
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,370
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

638
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,497
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.

639
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,597
That's one.

640
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,101
Sir, the suit is not combat ready.

641
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,201
That's two.

642
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,068
Tony!

643
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,603
Sir, take a deep breath.

644
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,163
Flight power restored.

645
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,637
Sir?

646
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,431
Sir!

647
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,559
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

648
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:57,688
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

649
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,645
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

650
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,440
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.

651
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,942
Why?

652
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:45,694
Jarvis. Not my idea.

653
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,489
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

654
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,990
I gotta get Pepper-

655
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,827
I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.

656
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,911
Who asked you?

657
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,955
Open the suit.

658
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,248
I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

659
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:58,332
Open it, J.

660
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,507
That's brisk.

661
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,308
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

662
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,311
I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.

663
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,980
Jarvis.

664
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,567
Jarvis?

665
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,238
Don't leave me, buddy.

666
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,597
Stark secure server now transferring
to all known receivers.

667
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,015
Pepper, it's me.

668
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,393
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...

669
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,354
First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

670
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:06,192
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

671
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,361
Also, it's Christmas time
and the rabbit's too big.

672
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,447
Done. Sorry.

673
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,016
And I'm sorry in advance

674
00:42:14,017 --> 00:42:16,577
because I can't come home yet.

675
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,788
I need to find this guy.

676
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,708
You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.

677
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,128
I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.

678
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,654
Let's get you comfy.

679
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,367
You happy now?

680
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,753
Freeze!

681
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,340
Don't move.

682
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,342
You got me.

683
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,595
Nice potato gun.

684
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,264
Barrel's a little long.

685
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:22,268
Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

686
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,690
And now you're out of ammo.

687
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,234
What's that thing on your chest?

688
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,445
It's an electromagnet.

689
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,114
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

690
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,032
What does it power?

691
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,960
Oh, my God.

692
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,254
That...

693
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,675
That's...
Is that Iron Man?

694
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,302
Technically, I am.

695
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,054
Technically, you're dead.

696
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,099
Valid point.

697
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,559
What happened to him?

698
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,060
Life.

699
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,730
I built him. I take care of him.

700
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:10,733
I'll fix him.

701
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:11,859
Like a mechanic?

702
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,402
Yeah.

703
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,823
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

704
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,991
It's "Iron Patriot" now-

705
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,242
That's way cooler.

706
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,660
No, it's not.

707
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,789
Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...

708
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,459
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

709
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,226
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

710
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,837
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

711
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,006
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

712
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,425
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

713
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:38,052
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

714
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:39,178
Sorry.

715
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:40,763
Are you?

716
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,558
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

717
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,352
So, who's home?

718
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:50,814
My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

719
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,943
I guess he won,
because that was 6 years ago.

720
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,606
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

721
00:44:58,689 --> 00:44:59,990
Here's what I need.

722
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,535
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

723
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,038
the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,

724
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,500
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

725
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,710
What's in it for me?

726
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,546
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

727
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:18,050
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

728
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,635
How'd you know that?

729
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,970
I got just the thing.

730
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,267
This is a pinata for a cricket.

731
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,644
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

732
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,398
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

733
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:33,565
it discourages bullying.

734
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:37,986
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

735
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,488
Deal? What do you say?

736
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,407
- Deal.
- Deal?

737
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,867
What's your name?

738
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,495
Harley. And you're...

739
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:47,955
The mechanic.

740
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,249
Tony.

741
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,211
You know what keeps
going through my head?

742
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,879
"Where's my sandwich?"

743
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,181
Where is Tony Stark?

744
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,255
Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.

745
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,465
Pepper, it's me.

746
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,468
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time so...

747
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:45,596
First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

748
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,056
That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.

749
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:51,810
Why were you at the house tonight?

750
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,397
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

751
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,196
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

752
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,948
So, if you still want to talk about it

753
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,118
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

754
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,289
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

755
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:14,583
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

756
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,419
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

757
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,838
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

758
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:21,632
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

759
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,253
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

760
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,889
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

761
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:34,478
We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.

762
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:35,604
- I see.
- No Stark.

763
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,315
I have to go.

764
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,651
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

765
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,320
Well, you know how he gets.

766
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,949
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

767
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,540
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

768
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,917
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

769
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,638
Report in.

770
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:12,683
Path is clear.

771
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,147
The master is travelling.

772
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:37,040
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

773
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:41,336
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

774
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,839
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

775
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,632
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

776
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,800
- Yeah?
- ...l was kind of hoping

777
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,219
for something a little more
adult than that.

778
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:52,931
She's 6.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

779
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,433
When can we talk about New York?

780
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,393
Maybe never. Relax about it.

781
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,936
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

782
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,230
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

783
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,863
What's the official story here?
What happened?

784
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:12,492
I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.

785
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,996
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

786
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,334
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

787
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,086
Then he blew himself up, right here.

788
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,178
- 6 people died, right?
- Yeah.

789
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,013
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

790
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,564
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

791
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:44,900
Think about it.

792
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,569
6 dead. Only 5 shadows.

793
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,154
Yeah.

794
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,074
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

795
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:55,535
Except the bomb guy.

796
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:59,498
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

797
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,999
That's why there's only 5.

798
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,044
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

799
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:09,800
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

800
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,344
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

801
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:18,058
That giant Wormhole in New York.

802
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,560
Does it remind you?

803
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,688
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

804
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,731
Are they coming back? The aliens?

805
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,108
Maybe. Can you stop?

806
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,986
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

807
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,863
Does this subject make you edgy?

808
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,199
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

809
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,118
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

810
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,620
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

811
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,497
- Do you have medication?
- No.

812
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:41,998
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

813
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,542
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

814
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,127
Are you going completely mental?

815
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,462
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

816
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,464
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

817
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,092
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

818
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,513
Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?

819
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,639
What did I say?

820
00:50:58,181 --> 00:50:59,391
Hey! Wait up!

821
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,269
Wait, wait.

822
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,984
What the hell was that?

823
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,157
Your fault. You spazzed me out.

824
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,202
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

825
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:20,495
The guy who died.

826
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,707
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs. Davis, where is she?

827
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,833
Where she always is.

828
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,544
See? Now, you're being helpful.

829
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,050
Sorry.

830
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,594
Lady?

831
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,513
Is this...

832
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:40,557
Thank you.

833
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,687
Nice haircut. it suits you.

834
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,230
Nice watch.

835
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,940
Yeah. A limited edition.

836
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,526
I don't doubt it.

837
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:53,820
Well, have a good evening.

838
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,542
Excuse me.

839
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:18,887
Mrs. Davis?

840
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:20,639
Mind if I join you?

841
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:22,516
Free country.

842
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:24,476
Sure is.

843
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,607
All right.

844
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,568
Where would you like to start?

845
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,113
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

846
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:38,657
I want to know
what you think happened.

847
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:45,747
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

848
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:50,502
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

849
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,464
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

850
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,757
Supposed to meet someone here?

851
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:56,883
Yeah.

852
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:13,149
Mrs. Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

853
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,110
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

854
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,946
Someone used him.

855
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,282
What?

856
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,868
As a weapon.

857
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,375
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

858
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,294
Actually, I am.

859
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,634
Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

860
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,720
It's called an arrest.

861
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,807
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

862
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:47,934
Homeland Security. We good here?

863
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,853
No, we're not "good."

864
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,438
I need a little more information
than that.

865
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,899
I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

866
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,444
Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?

867
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,323
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way

868
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,158
but the fun way is always good.

869
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,036
Deputy, get this woman out of...

870
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,093
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

871
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,859
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

872
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,403
Watch this.

873
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:50,390
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

874
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,767
That's all you got?

875
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,687
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

876
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,149
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

877
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,961
- Let me go!
- Help me!

878
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,342
Anyway-

879
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,595
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

880
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:12,639
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

881
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:13,932
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

882
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,934
"I want my goddamn file."

883
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,393
It's not your fault, kid.

884
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,898
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

885
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:29,572
You like that, Westworld?

886
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,407
That's the thing about smart guys,

887
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,993
we always cover our ass.

888
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,103
You're welcome.

889
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:02,772
For what? Did I miss something?

890
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,816
Me, saving your life.

891
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:08,027
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

892
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:10,864
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

893
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:14,242
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

894
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,119
Unlike you?

895
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,581
Admit it, you need me.

896
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,207
We're connected.

897
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,334
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

898
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,837
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

899
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,172
and stay connected to the telephone,

900
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,965
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

901
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,177
Can you feel that? We're done here.

902
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,511
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

903
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,305
Bye, kid.

904
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:43,396
I'm sorry, kid.

905
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,106
You did good.

906
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:48,067
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

907
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:51,196
Yeah.

908
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,032
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

909
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,742
I'm cold.

910
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:58,286
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

911
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,289
Because we're connected.

912
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,212
It was worth a shot.

913
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,976
You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.

914
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,436
It goes with any decor...

915
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:27,649
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

916
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,736
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

917
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:32,820
I'm trying. There's nothing I can...

918
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:33,905
Well, where is the feed coming from?

919
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,074
I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...

920
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,284
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

921
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:39,702
It's not just our station.

922
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:40,870
What about a backup manual?

923
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,997
We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...

924
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:47,043
Mr. Vice President,
I think you should see this.

925
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,505
Oh, God, not again.

926
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,340
Is the President getting this?

927
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,186
Mr. President.

928
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,438
Only two lessons remain.

929
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,567
And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.

930
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,404
Meet Thomas Richards.

931
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:17,657
Good strong name. Good strong job.

932
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:23,538
Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

933
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:28,543
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

934
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,046
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

935
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:35,633
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

936
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:36,843
No!

937
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,305
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

938
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:43,516
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

939
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,351
America,

940
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,563
if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,

941
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:50,356
Tom lives.

942
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,441
Go!

943
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,028
How did he hack my phone?

944
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,071
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

945
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,406
I have to make this call.

946
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,866
I'd strongly advise against that.

947
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:02,577
This is the right thing to do.

948
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:31,564
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.

949
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,524
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

950
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:34,609
Because nothing,

951
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,111
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

952
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,197
can save you.

953
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,659
I'll see you soon.

954
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,123
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

955
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,917
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

956
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,835
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

957
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,045
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

958
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,297
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

959
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,146
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-

960
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,204
Don't move!

961
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:35,503
Hang on a second.

962
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,380
Hello?

963
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,215
You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up

964
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:43,136
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

965
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,720
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

966
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:45,763
It's me, pal.

967
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:47,932
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

968
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,017
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

969
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,477
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

970
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:52,562
What are you doing?

971
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,773
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

972
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:56,858
Yeah.

973
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,820
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.

974
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,156
It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."

975
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,282
And password, please.

976
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:06,409
Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

977
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,828
It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

978
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,912
Give me your login.

979
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,958
"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an "X," all caps.

980
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,671
Yeah, okay.

981
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:22,008
That is so much better
than "lron Patriot."

982
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,684
Very nice. Very nice.

983
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,479
I have one question for you.

984
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:37,106
What would you like
for Christmas this year?

985
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,234
Well, David...

986
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:47,116
Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

987
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,499
One more time!
Ms. Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.

988
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,212
Because you erase my shows!

989
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,009
That ain't gonna cut it.

990
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,220
We talked about this.

991
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,806
Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...

992
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,937
Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

993
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:19,065
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

994
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,691
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

995
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:21,817
I knew you were still alive!

996
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,569
Come on in. Close the door.

997
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:29,742
Wow. Can I just say, sir...

998
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:30,952
Yep.

999
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:32,912
I am your biggest fan.

1000
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:34,956
First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1001
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,290
No, no, no. Just us.

1002
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:37,458
Great. What's your name?

1003
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,126
- Gary
- Gary

1004
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,255
- Wow.
- Right there is fine.

1005
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,548
- Okay.
- Okay?

1006
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:44,757
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1007
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,176
- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

1008
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:49,680
I don't know if you can tell,

1009
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:52,890
but I have patterned
my whole look after you.

1010
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,350
- My hair's a little...
- it's fine.

1011
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,977
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1012
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,853
Right.

1013
01:04:58,104 --> 01:05:01,983
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1014
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,442
Boom!

1015
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,654
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1016
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,448
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

1017
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:14,287
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1018
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,832
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1019
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,836
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1020
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,838
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.

1021
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,632
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1022
01:05:26,716 --> 01:05:27,842
I don't have enough juice.

1023
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:30,261
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1024
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,555
Recalibrate the lSDNs.

1025
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,682
Pump it up by about 40%.

1026
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,267
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

1027
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,351
Yeah.

1028
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,437
Tony needs Gary.

1029
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,688
And Gary needs Tony.

1030
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,106
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:09,175
What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?

1032
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,136
I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.

1033
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,474
Will you please state your name
for the camera?

1034
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,808
Ellen Brandt.

1035
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,229
Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.

1036
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,731
Addiction will not be tolerated.

1037
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,776
Those who cannot regulate
will be out from the programme.

1038
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,988
Once misfits, cripples...

1039
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:34,742
You are the next iteration
of human evolution.

1040
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:40,915
Everybody, before we start...

1041
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:44,210
I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter

1042
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:48,422
as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.

1043
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,174
Today is your glory-

1044
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:51,342
Let's begin.

1045
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:03,938
We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!

1046
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,189
Get her out!
Get them out of here!

1047
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:15,282
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1048
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,995
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1049
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,289
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1050
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:24,709
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1051
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,545
Got you, pal.

1052
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,632
What happened?

1053
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:34,301
Fun fact.

1054
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:37,513
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1055
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:42,017
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

1056
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,311
dreamed of space travel.

1057
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,440
He stargazed.

1058
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:51,277
Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?

1059
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:55,740
"The rocket performed perfectly.

1060
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,327
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1061
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:06,000
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1062
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:11,630
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1063
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:14,967
And you look up,

1064
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,305
you're a long way from shore.

1065
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,391
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1066
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:25,561
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1067
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:29,190
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1068
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,817
That's exactly what we used to do.

1069
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,111
So, don't judge yourself.

1070
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:37,615
Thank you, Pepper.

1071
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,618
I really appreciate that.

1072
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,586
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

1073
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,756
Maya, run!

1074
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:57,593
Hi, Pepper.

1075
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,388
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1076
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:02,807
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1077
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,184
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1078
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:08,646
I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?

1079
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,606
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1080
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,693
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1081
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,738
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1082
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:21,367
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1083
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,915
This is support team Blue-Zero.

1084
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,868
Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

1085
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:31,794
Copy-

1086
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,095
Nobody move.

1087
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,268
Support Blue-Zero,

1088
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,270
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1089
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:50,938
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1090
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,440
I think you messed up again.

1091
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:56,360
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.

1092
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:57,695
It's... Of course.

1093
01:09:57,778 --> 01:09:58,779
Yes, ma'am.

1094
01:09:58,946 --> 01:09:59,989
Iron Patriot on the job.

1095
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:01,156
Happy to help.

1096
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,449
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1097
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,826
It's my pleasure.

1098
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,211
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.

1099
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:15,546
If you want this suit,

1100
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,965
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1101
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:19,758
That's the plan, Colonel.

1102
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,929
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1103
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:27,308
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1104
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:29,226
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

1105
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:32,313
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

1106
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,480
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1107
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,399
Jarvis, how are we?

1108
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,735
It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,

1109
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:40,863
and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.

1110
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:42,239
And, sir, you were right.

1111
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,992
Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities

1112
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:47,494
I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

1113
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,914
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...

1114
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,957
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

1115
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,459
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

1116
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:56,420
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1117
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,880
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1118
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,381
but not right now.

1119
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:00,466
Harley, where is he really?

1120
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:02,051
Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.

1121
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,221
It does say Miami, Florida.

1122
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:09,266
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

1123
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:10,768
It's not charging.

1124
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:21,320
Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.

1125
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:23,822
It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.

1126
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,824
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1127
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:29,787
It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...

1128
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:31,830
Oh, God, not again.

1129
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,624
Tony?

1130
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,586
Are you having another attack?

1131
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:38,963
I didn't even mention New York.

1132
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:42,508
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1133
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:44,385
Okay...

1134
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:47,680
God, what am I gonna do?

1135
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:51,308
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1136
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,228
You're a mechanic, right?

1137
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,771
Right.

1138
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:57,940
You said so.

1139
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:00,401
Yes, I did.

1140
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:03,404
Why don't you just build something?

1141
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,458
Okay.

1142
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:18,502
Thanks, kid.

1143
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:07,277
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1144
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,695
My fault again.

1145
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,532
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1146
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:12,968
Well.

1147
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,805
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1148
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:20,392
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1149
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:21,768
That's me.

1150
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:23,395
Nessie.

1151
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:28,567
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1152
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,152
There's some guy over here.

1153
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,447
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1154
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:34,740
Hey!

1155
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,068
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1156
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:39,494
Don't move.

1157
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,705
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1158
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:42,789
Although the guns are all fake

1159
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,708
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1160
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,044
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1161
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:50,297
Heard enough.

1162
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,466
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1163
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,675
Where?

1164
01:15:53,759 --> 01:15:55,928
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

1165
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:58,972
He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.

1166
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,641
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

1167
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,809
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1168
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,645
- It is.
- It's complicated.

1169
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,063
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.

1170
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,189
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1171
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:11,652
Sit.

1172
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:13,779
Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:23,956
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1174
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,082
What are you?

1175
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,793
A decoy? You're a double, right?

1176
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:30,963
You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1177
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,840
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1178
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:36,718
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1179
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:40,764
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.

1180
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,225
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1181
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:51,358
Well, I had a little problem
with substances.

1182
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:55,696
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1183
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:58,073
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1184
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,700
- Next?
- Then,

1185
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,661
they approached me
about the role,

1186
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,162
and they knew about the drugs.

1187
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:05,414
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1188
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:07,207
They said they'd give me more.

1189
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:08,333
They gave me things.

1190
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,920
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1191
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,256
They gave me things.

1192
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:16,550
Did you just nod off?

1193
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:17,718
Hey.

1194
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,636
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1195
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,139
And the thing was, he needed someone

1196
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:26,143
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1197
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:30,564
"He"?

1198
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,152
- Killian?
- Killian.

1199
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:38,071
- He created you?
- He created me.

1200
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,781
Custom-made terror threat.

1201
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:42,075
Yes. Yes.

1202
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,036
His think tank thinked it up.

1203
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,747
The pathology of a serial killer.

1204
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:49,833
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1205
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:53,420
Ready for another lesson?

1206
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,963
Blah, blah, blah.

1207
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:56,506
No.

1208
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,551
Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1209
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,178
Your performance?

1210
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,180
Where people died?

1211
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,973
No, they didn't.

1212
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,977
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1213
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:11,188
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1214
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:13,065
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1215
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,317
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1216
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,568
and he might not wake up.

1217
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:17,986
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1218
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,571
You're still going down, pal.

1219
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,655
You under...

1220
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:30,248
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1221
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,834
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

1222
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:34,836
No.

1223
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,421
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1224
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,633
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1225
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,397
Okay.

1226
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,990
It's just like old times, huh?

1227
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:07,077
Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

1228
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,787
It wasn't my idea.

1229
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,872
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1230
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,040
I took his money.

1231
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:14,501
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1232
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,420
- No.
- Yeah.

1233
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,171
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1234
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,090
Yeah?

1235
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:25,470
A lot has happened, Tony.

1236
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,889
But I'm close.

1237
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,684
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1238
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,936
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1239
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,438
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1240
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:35,856
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1241
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,190
Then help me fix it.

1242
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:43,864
Did I do that?

1243
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,199
Yes.

1244
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,909
I remember the night, not the morning.

1245
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,203
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1246
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,372
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1247
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,960
You used to have a moral psychology.

1248
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,212
You used to have ideals.

1249
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,965
You wanted to help people.

1250
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,925
Now look at you.

1251
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,928
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1252
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,766
still has their soul.

1253
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:18,440
Get me out of here.

1254
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:22,903
Come on.

1255
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,489
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1256
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:29,868
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1257
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:34,331
"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."

1258
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:36,666
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1259
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,169
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1260
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,254
I'm here to thank you.

1261
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,632
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1262
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,884
Desperation.

1263
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,094
If you think back to Switzerland,

1264
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,181
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1265
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,142
Well for the first 20 minutes,

1266
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,561
I actually thought you'd show up.

1267
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:58,438
And the next hour...

1268
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:04,444
I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1269
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:05,737
If you know what I mean.

1270
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,115
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1271
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,868
But as I looked out over that city,

1272
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,788
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,

1273
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,123
no one was even looking.

1274
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:21,211
I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.

1275
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:23,004
Anonymity, Tony.

1276
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,299
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1277
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,634
Right?

1278
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,136
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1279
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,681
Because the second
you give evil a face,

1280
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,725
a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,

1281
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,394
you hand the people a target.

1282
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,145
You're something else.

1283
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,482
You have met him, I assume?

1284
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,150
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1285
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,570
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1286
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,363
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1287
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,489
He's a stage actor.

1288
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,577
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1289
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,704
Anyway, the point is,

1290
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:59,124
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1291
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,500
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1292
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,752
What's next for you in your world?

1293
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:07,966
I wanted to repay you the self same gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1294
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:15,765
Desperation.

1295
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:17,767
Now, this is live.

1296
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:21,062
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1297
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:25,609
the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.

1298
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:27,527
And if it gives up,

1299
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,532
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1300
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,911
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1301
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:41,625
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1302
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,210
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1303
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:46,087
Let him go.

1304
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,381
Hold on, hold on.

1305
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:50,383
Maya...

1306
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,427
I said, let him go.

1307
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:54,596
What are you doing?

1308
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,390
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1309
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:02,479
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1310
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,897
Maya, give me the injector.

1311
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,441
If I die, Killian,

1312
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:09,611
What happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1313
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:10,904
We're not doing this, okay?

1314
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:14,324
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1315
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:27,295
The good news is,

1316
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,882
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1317
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:41,559
You are a maniac.

1318
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:43,812
No, I'm a visionary.

1319
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,356
But I do own a maniac.

1320
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:49,401
And he takes the stage tonight.

1321
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,197
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1322
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,242
it will take me
9 or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1323
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:59,953
That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.

1324
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,419
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1325
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:12,590
Hello, Colonel.

1326
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,926
Step aside.

1327
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,103
We'll get you out of there.

1328
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,312
Don't worry.

1329
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,773
You'll damage the armour.

1330
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:30,400
Yes, I will.

1331
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:32,152
But you can fix it, right?

1332
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,739
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1333
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:37,323
And I want Potts with me.

1334
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:38,408
She's still in Phase 2.

1335
01:24:40,452 --> 01:24:41,494
You're not going deaf, are you?

1336
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:00,680
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.

1337
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,140
Hey, Ponytail Express.

1338
01:25:03,475 --> 01:25:05,310
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1339
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,519
832 miles.

1340
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:08,104
Very nice.

1341
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:09,522
I'm good like that.

1342
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,608
Can you stop that?

1343
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:13,234
Break it, you bought it.

1344
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:16,613
I think I bought it.

1345
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,157
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1346
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,659
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1347
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:23,828
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1348
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,538
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1349
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,874
This.

1350
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:31,961
That.

1351
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,343
Are you coming out?

1352
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:43,389
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1353
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:44,474
All right. Let's go.

1354
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,859
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1355
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:02,116
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1356
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,160
This time tomorrow,

1357
01:26:04,244 --> 01:26:07,831
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1358
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,668
and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.

1359
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,921
I'll own the war on terror.

1360
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:16,965
Create supply and demand.

1361
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:21,386
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1362
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,682
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1363
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,184
on the ground in 5, 4, 3...

1364
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:29,561
Come on! 2...

1365
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,605
How did we get this shift?

1366
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:34,148
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1367
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,025
Put down your weapons.

1368
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,486
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1369
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,947
In 5, 4, bang!

1370
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:42,115
Wow.

1371
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,033
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1372
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,660
I am just beyond terrified.

1373
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,245
Here it comes.

1374
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:49,664
- 3, 4...
- Shut up.

1375
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,499
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

1376
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,002
Told you.

1377
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:06,723
Where's the rest?

1378
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:08,576
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1379
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,334
Better late than never.

1380
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:24,258
Not this time. Not the face.

1381
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:27,637
It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1382
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,055
Hello, sir.

1383
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:36,646
All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.

1384
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,607
Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.

1385
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:40,900
Let's go!

1386
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:42,568
Crap.

1387
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:56,374
Tony?

1388
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:57,750
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1389
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,919
No. You got yours?

1390
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,130
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1391
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,007
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

1392
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:11,556
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1393
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,142
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1394
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:15,435
What's this? I had winners.

1395
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:24,777
What have you come as?

1396
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:27,280
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1397
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,243
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1398
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,703
This is the Mandarin?

1399
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,788
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1400
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,665
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1401
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:40,877
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1402
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,714
But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1403
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,257
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1404
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,468
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1405
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,094
Doing what?

1406
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:52,346
I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!

1407
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:56,142
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1408
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:58,394
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1409
01:29:58,478 --> 01:29:59,520
What? No.

1410
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:02,065
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1411
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:05,568
Something to do with a big boat.

1412
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:06,986
I can take you there.

1413
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,530
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...

1414
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:12,617
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1415
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:16,662
And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1416
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,414
Is that...
Is that important?

1417
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,291
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1418
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,128
So?

1419
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,047
What are we gonna do?

1420
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,215
We don't have any transport.

1421
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,299
Right.

1422
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,302
Hey, Ringo.

1423
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,013
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1424
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,726
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1425
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:39,936
But we also have to figure out

1426
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,771
- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1427
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,064
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1428
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,148
That's the vice president.

1429
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,691
Thanks.

1430
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,443
Hello?

1431
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,195
Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1432
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,155
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1433
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,491
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1434
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,159
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1435
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,912
Mr. Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1436
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,248
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1437
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,626
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1438
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,752
I think we're good, here.

1439
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:06,838
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.

1440
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,923
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1441
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:10,550
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.

1442
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,260
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1443
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,595
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1444
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,598
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1445
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,183
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

1446
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,812
Everything okay, sir?

1447
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:24,897
Couldn't be better.

1448
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,239
I love you, babe.

1449
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,344
Colonel Rhodes.

1450
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:58,764
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1451
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:04,729
We gotta make a decision.

1452
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:07,607
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1453
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,400
Sir, I have an update from Malibu.

1454
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,611
The cranes have finally arrived,

1455
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,738
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.

1456
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,531
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1457
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,950
The armour is now at 92%.

1458
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:20,119
That's going to have to do.

1459
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:30,254
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.

1460
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:31,380
Sure.

1461
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:49,690
Everything all right, Colonel?

1462
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:24,725
It is an honour, Mr. President.

1463
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:27,103
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1464
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,438
Cool your boots, sir.

1465
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:31,023
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1466
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,609
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1467
01:33:33,693 --> 01:33:35,611
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1468
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:36,862
Get me eyes on it now.

1469
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:39,156
Image coming through now, sir.

1470
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,369
Was that Rhodes?

1471
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:53,879
Is anyone there?

1472
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:55,881
Let us out!

1473
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:13,858
The President.

1474
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:15,568
Now.

1475
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,652
He's not here.

1476
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,533
Try the jet stream?

1477
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:25,578
Speaking of which, go fish.

1478
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,269
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1479
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:04,283
How many in the air?

1480
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,993
13, sir.

1481
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:09,914
- How many can I carry?
- 4, sir.

1482
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,927
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1483
01:35:28,057 --> 01:35:30,601
Oh, God! No! No!

1484
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,437
Listen to me. See that guy?

1485
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:35,314
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1486
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,024
- You got it?
- What?

1487
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:42,863
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1488
01:35:44,115 --> 01:35:45,324
We can do this, Heather.

1489
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,460
Easy, see? 11 more to go.

1490
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,924
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1491
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:03,092
That's what we're going to do.

1492
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,427
18,000 feet.

1493
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:05,886
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1494
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:12,226
Nice.

1495
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,228
10,000 feet.

1496
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:18,858
6,000 feet.

1497
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,568
Come on, people.

1498
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:22,736
Come on, come on, come on!

1499
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,158
Yeah!

1500
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,076
1,000 feet.

1501
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:31,829
400 feet.

1502
01:36:32,413 --> 01:36:33,622
200 feet, sir.

1503
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:34,832
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1504
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,042
Hello.

1505
01:36:58,397 --> 01:36:59,482
We made it!

1506
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:01,692
Nice work, guys!

1507
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,403
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1508
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:05,779
All right, Jarvis.

1509
01:37:05,863 --> 01:37:07,406
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1510
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:16,874
That came out of nowhere.

1511
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:18,167
Wow.

1512
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,710
Give me some good news, man.

1513
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:20,794
I think they all made it.

1514
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:21,837
Thank God.

1515
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:22,922
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1516
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,299
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1517
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:27,510
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1518
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:29,637
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1519
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,639
The House Party Protocol, sir?

1520
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:32,765
Correct.

1521
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:04,463
Hi.

1522
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:14,306
You think he's gonna help you?

1523
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:16,392
He won't.

1524
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:24,775
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...

1525
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:27,945
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1526
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:30,239
You're here as my...

1527
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:32,992
trophy-

1528
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,547
Good evening, sir.

1529
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:53,929
Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

1530
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:04,023
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?

1531
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:08,902
Well, 2 years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1532
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,364
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1533
01:39:12,615 --> 01:39:13,616
And, of course, you'll remember

1534
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:16,368
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1535
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:19,371
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1536
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,540
What do you want from me?

1537
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:23,751
Nothing, sir.

1538
01:39:24,126 --> 01:39:27,588
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1539
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:29,715
You see, I've moved on.

1540
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:32,176
I found myself a new political patron,

1541
01:39:32,593 --> 01:39:35,387
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1542
01:39:36,388 --> 01:39:38,223
String him up.

1543
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:40,893
Hey!

1544
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,619
Come on.

1545
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:04,041
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1546
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:05,834
I hope not.

1547
01:40:30,484 --> 01:40:32,319
Oh, my God.

1548
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:36,073
He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.

1549
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,742
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1550
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:40,619
Yeah, death by oil.

1551
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:49,837
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1552
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,423
Okay. That's good.

1553
01:40:52,506 --> 01:40:56,343
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1554
01:40:57,511 --> 01:40:58,762
Is your gun up?

1555
01:40:58,846 --> 01:41:00,431
Yep. What do I do?

1556
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:02,975
Stay on my 6, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1557
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,310
6, high, back. All right.

1558
01:41:14,236 --> 01:41:15,529
You see that? Nailed it.

1559
01:41:16,155 --> 01:41:17,364
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1560
01:41:17,573 --> 01:41:18,657
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1561
01:41:18,741 --> 01:41:19,742
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1562
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:22,911
All personnel, we have hostiles

1563
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:24,037
- on east unit 12.
- Over there!

1564
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:25,831
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...

1565
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:28,208
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

1566
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,419
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1567
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:31,795
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

1568
01:41:31,879 --> 01:41:32,963
You've got, like, 5 of them.

1569
01:41:33,046 --> 01:41:34,256
Here's what I'm going to do.

1570
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:36,300
Save my spot, ready?

1571
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:39,178
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

1572
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,554
Here we go.

1573
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,351
3 guys, one girl, all armed.

1574
01:41:56,445 --> 01:41:57,988
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.

1575
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,032
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

1576
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,826
You know what?

1577
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:07,873
Is that...

1578
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,833
Yep-

1579
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,543
- Are those...
- Yeah.

1580
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:29,478
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1581
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:37,486
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1582
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,404
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1583
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:40,906
Yes, sir.

1584
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:47,788
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1585
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:50,332
Take them to church.

1586
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:59,091
Gentlemen.

1587
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:07,349
Incoming!

1588
01:43:11,979 --> 01:43:13,605
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1589
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,620
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1590
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:29,788
Everybody needs a hobby.

1591
01:43:36,295 --> 01:43:37,671
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1592
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:07,826
Nice timing.

1593
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:10,120
Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1594
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:13,248
I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

1595
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,584
- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.

1596
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:21,256
Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?

1597
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,799
Very funny.

1598
01:44:39,858 --> 01:44:41,151
Sir, I've located Ms. Potts.

1599
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,235
About time.

1600
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:59,711
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1601
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:04,383
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1602
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:06,802
You're such a jerk.

1603
01:45:06,969 --> 01:45:08,220
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1604
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:12,057
Come on. A little more, baby.

1605
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:29,616
Is this guy bothering you?

1606
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:32,786
Don't get up.

1607
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,542
Is it hot in there?

1608
01:45:40,836 --> 01:45:42,045
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1609
01:45:43,296 --> 01:45:46,591
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1610
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:47,926
Tony.

1611
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,012
She's watching.

1612
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,931
I think you should close your eyes.

1613
01:45:53,432 --> 01:45:54,933
Close your eyes.

1614
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,769
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1615
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,903
Yeah, you take a minute.

1616
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:41,563
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1617
01:46:52,574 --> 01:46:53,575
Come on!

1618
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:58,705
Mr. President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1619
01:46:59,623 --> 01:47:02,000
Just hold on. Hold on.

1620
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:16,223
Okay.

1621
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:25,023
Bye-bye.

1622
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:37,911
Brace yourself.

1623
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,757
You look damn good, Mr. President,

1624
01:47:50,924 --> 01:47:52,384
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1625
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:07,107
The President is secure, Tony.

1626
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,525
- I'm clearing the area.
- Nice work.

1627
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:11,862
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1628
01:48:20,078 --> 01:48:22,831
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1629
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:23,915
Just look at me!

1630
01:48:26,418 --> 01:48:28,420
Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.

1631
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:30,213
All right?
You've got to let go.

1632
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:33,758
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1633
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:37,179
No!

1634
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:07,083
A shame. I would've caught her.

1635
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,241
Eject.

1636
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:26,246
Well, here we are on the roof.

1637
01:50:36,965 --> 01:50:38,049
Mark 42, inbound.

1638
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:41,553
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1639
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,528
Whatever.

1640
01:50:59,738 --> 01:51:01,239
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1641
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:06,619
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1642
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:11,750
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1643
01:51:11,916 --> 01:51:14,210
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1644
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:17,505
Here's where you're wrong.

1645
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:18,798
She was already perfect.

1646
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:28,183
Jarvis,

1647
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:30,769
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1648
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,270
No...

1649
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:48,304
No more false faces.

1650
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,974
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1651
01:52:52,142 --> 01:52:54,853
You're looking right at him.

1652
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,189
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1653
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,358
I am the Mandarin!

1654
01:53:11,786 --> 01:53:13,037
I got nothing.

1655
01:53:19,878 --> 01:53:22,630
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1656
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:32,807
What?
What, are you mad at me?

1657
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:00,126
Honey?

1658
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,049
Oh, my God.

1659
01:54:07,592 --> 01:54:09,802
That was really violent.

1660
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,805
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1661
01:54:12,972 --> 01:54:15,016
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1662
01:54:18,478 --> 01:54:20,146
Who's the hot mess now?

1663
01:54:20,313 --> 01:54:22,398
It's still debatable.

1664
01:54:22,941 --> 01:54:26,361
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?

1665
01:54:26,444 --> 01:54:28,363
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1666
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:31,658
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1667
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:34,369
What am I going to complain
about now?

1668
01:54:35,203 --> 01:54:36,829
Well, it's me.

1669
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:38,665
You'll think of something.

1670
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,626
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

1671
01:54:41,709 --> 01:54:43,628
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

1672
01:54:44,671 --> 01:54:45,672
Not hot.

1673
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,758
Am I gonna be okay?

1674
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:49,842
No.

1675
01:54:49,968 --> 01:54:52,637
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1676
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:54,764
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1677
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:56,724
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1678
01:54:56,808 --> 01:54:59,936
I think I can get you better.

1679
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:03,064
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1680
01:55:03,147 --> 01:55:05,441
And all your distractions?

1681
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:08,069
I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1682
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,697
Jarvis. Hey.

1683
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:14,075
All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1684
01:55:14,325 --> 01:55:16,286
You know what to do.

1685
01:55:16,369 --> 01:55:19,122
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?

1686
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:22,375
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1687
01:55:58,661 --> 01:55:59,954
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

1688
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,541
It Will do.

1689
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:18,139
And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.

1690
01:56:21,517 --> 01:56:23,519
You start with something pure,

1691
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,775
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.

1692
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:31,569
The compromises.

1693
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:40,828
We create our own demons.

1694
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,252
Great to see you! Bloody hell!

1695
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:53,508
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.

1696
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:57,387
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"

1697
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:04,560
Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,

1698
01:57:04,644 --> 01:57:08,147
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.

1699
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:11,609
And now, neither will I.

1700
01:57:12,402 --> 01:57:14,320
Let me tell you,

1701
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:16,531
that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.

1702
01:57:37,427 --> 01:57:39,387
It's okay. It's okay.

1703
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,513
It's okay.

1704
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:41,597
No, look.

1705
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:02,929
So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...

1706
01:59:03,012 --> 01:59:07,308
I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,

1707
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:09,477
or a hobby.

1708
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
It was a cocoon.

1709
01:59:12,772 --> 01:59:14,565
And now,

1710
01:59:15,525 --> 01:59:17,819
I'm a changed man.

1711
01:59:26,744 --> 01:59:30,414
You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.

1712
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:34,252
One thing you can't take away...

1713
01:59:36,796 --> 01:59:38,589
I am Iron Man.

1714
02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:06,740
You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.

1715
02:09:06,824 --> 02:09:09,284
Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,

1716
02:09:09,368 --> 02:09:12,913
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...

1717
02:09:12,996 --> 02:09:15,707
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.

1718
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:18,836
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.

1719
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:21,422
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1720
02:09:21,505 --> 02:09:22,631
and my experiences with someone,

1721
02:09:22,714 --> 02:09:25,259
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1722
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:26,718
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1723
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:28,554
Everything comes full circle.

1724
02:09:28,637 --> 02:09:32,057
And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...

1725
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:36,061
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.

1726
02:09:36,145 --> 02:09:37,229
We were at...

1727
02:09:37,438 --> 02:09:38,647
Are you actively napping?

1728
02:09:38,772 --> 02:09:41,024
I was... I... I drifted.

1729
02:09:41,525 --> 02:09:42,693
Where did I lose you?

1730
02:09:44,695 --> 02:09:46,363
Elevator in Switzerland.

1731
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:49,408
So, you heard none of it.

1732
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:52,703
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1733
02:09:53,328 --> 02:09:54,621
I'm not a therapist.

1734
02:09:54,788 --> 02:09:56,665
- It's not my training.
- So?

1735
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:58,417
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

1736
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,751
Temperament.

1737
02:10:00,002 --> 02:10:01,545
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1738
02:10:01,628 --> 02:10:03,005
God, my original wound.

1739
02:10:03,255 --> 02:10:05,424
