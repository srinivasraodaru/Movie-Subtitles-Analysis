1
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,225
Oh... boy...

2
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,810
That's a fast fish.

3
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:58,771
C'mon... C'mon! C'mon!

4
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,523
Look at that!

5
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:02,734
Son of a bitch!

6
00:03:58,057 --> 00:03:59,100
Help...!

7
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,186
Help me...!

8
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:24,292
PIRANHA

9
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,925
Officer! It was a mistake.

10
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,051
Can't we work something out here?

11
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:40,678
No! Mistake or no mistake.
you just destroyed public property.

12
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,096
And from the smell of your breath!

13
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,556
I suggest you take the ticket.

14
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:44,891
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

15
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,519
Oh, I don't know, I was kinda
hoping you might drive me home.

16
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,480
Touching a officer's uniform is consider assault?

17
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:51,814
Are you aware of that?

18
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:52,757
C'mon...

19
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,234
You look pretty hot in a tan.

20
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:58,279
It's not tan...

21
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,322
It's beige.

22
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,575
Hey, you think you can take it easy on us?

23
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,118
You boys take one more step!

24
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:05,954
You'll be pissing lightning bolts into next week.

25
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,038
Okay!

26
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:26,099
Yeah! Pretty much your everyday in college.

27
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,225
Kelly! Hey! Hmm...

28
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:28,893
I wasn't sure you were coming back...

29
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:31,145
for spring break.

30
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,272
Yeah! I'm... I'm here.

31
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,943
I can only assume you're here to
get on one of those boats.

32
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,111
No, no...

33
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:41,239
I came down here to pick up
my little sister for music lessons.

34
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,323
How bout yourself?

35
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,409
I'm just waiting for my ride.

36
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,495
Todd and his friends... We're gonna
go check out some music.

37
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,663
Todd Dupree?

38
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,374
Remind me who you going out with again?

39
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,502
Guy have standards alright!
That's all I'm saying.

40
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,714
Look! Todd's a really good DJ.

41
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:02,218
Kelly!

42
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,636
Let's go! Jump in, we're late!

43
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,333
Listen! He says he's got backstage passes for "Planners".

44
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,142
You should come.

45
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:10,810
Yeah I would...

46
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,563
But I'm pretty much under house arrest
watching Zana and Laura...

47
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:14,063
Then too bad.

48
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,858
I'll miss ya.

49
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:18,610
Anyway look! I'd gotta go.

50
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,527
C'mon! Let's go!

51
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:23,239
Yeah, yeah and hopefully I'll see
you again before you...

52
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:24,574
or you'll leave...

53
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:26,576
Gonna make a move, Jake.

54
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,996
Hey! Asswipe!

55
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,498
Cool shirt!

56
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,384

58
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,262
Nice boobs.

59
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,056
Thanks

60
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:49,182
I have a training bra...

61
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,433
but I do not like to wear it.

62
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,559
Cos it itches.

63
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,436
Tell me about it.

64
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,898
Who're you waiting for?

65
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,858
My brother Jake. He's 17.

66
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,819
He'll like your boobs too.

67
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,820
They all do.

68
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,946
C'mon Laura, let's go.

69
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:04,364
What happened to you?

70
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:06,574
Look. I don't want to talk
about it okay. Let's go.

71
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:07,826
Hi Jake!

72
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,537
Try not to stare at her boobs.

73
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:11,579
Shut up.

74
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,165
I like your shirt.

75
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:16,042
Why? You want to throw something at me too?

76
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,753
No! Actually I like The Pixies.

77
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:19,754
Danni, Danni...

78
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,422
Where the hell is Crystal?

79
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,298
She's over there with Andrew...

80
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:23,967
They're gettin sunscreen.

81
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,801
We're just waiting.

82
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:25,760
Sunscreen?

83
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:27,679
Andrew! Crystal! we don't need sunscreen!

84
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,097
We need body paint! We need condoms!

85
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:30,098
We need ready whip!

86
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,182
You tell her 10 am tomorrow.

87
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:33,935
I want her bleached, blonded, booty at the marina.

00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,436

00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:36,479
So bright and early baby!

Make sure those tities are nice and perky!

91
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,568
Who's this?

92
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:43,611
This is Jake.

93
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:44,654
He's a lifeful.

94
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:46,906
A sandrat huh?

95
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:48,658
You know your way around the lake?

96
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:49,242
Aah... Yeah!

97
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,719
You wanna job? I pay cash money.

98
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,037
Don't bullshit me Jake.

99
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:55,582

00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,001
Ambition,

103
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,478
Someone who's willing to take chances...

104
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:01,462
... If you know what I mean.

105
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,965

106
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,009
Yeah, well you're short.

107
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,093

115
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,107

119
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,367

00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:46,674
I need you.

130
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:49,677
We're talking life lessons here, Jake.

131
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:51,804
Great!

132

133
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:53,598
Don't be late.

134
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:55,892
And... wear a different shirt.

135
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:58,603

138
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,717
Why you're gonna knock if
you're just gonna walk in?!

139
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:39,227
Am I disturbing you?

140
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,645
No, I'm just...

141
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,230

142
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,108
and school work and research for school.

143
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,761
Laura!

144
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:50,430
Have been telling me that you may have
some other plans...

145
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:51,447
for tomorrow.

146
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,283
No! What's she talking about...

147
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,434
I'm a 100% baby sitting.

148
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:57,412
What? No, no... we don't want a babysitter!

149
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:59,122
Yeah mom! Especially not Jake.

150
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:00,957
Please...
- especially not Jake...

151
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:01,791
I'm serious.

152
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,002
No! We don't need one now!
- Get out, out, out!

153
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:04,836
Out...

154
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,881
Mom! C'mon... Please! We have to talk about this...

155
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:08,673
Mom...

156
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:11,217
Jake, you know I do not have a backup.

157
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,803
Yeah I know mom.

158
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,139
Yeah don't worry. I know how
crazy this week is for you.

159
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,223
And...

160
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,434
I'll take care of the nitwits, okay.

161
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,061
Remember, if you do not fulfill your responsiblity...

162
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,714
I have the power to arrest and...

163
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,123
and imprison you.

164
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,066
Mom, I'm not 12 okay.

165
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,894
playing the sheriff card isn't gonna work anymore.

166
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:31,321
No?
- No.

167
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:34,282
Like I said, I'll take care of it okay?

168
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,242
Alright.

169
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:37,619
Better.

170
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:38,953
Get outta here.

171
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:41,539
Alright... Well next year I'll try to find another solution.

172
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:42,665
Alright.
- Alright!

173
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:43,708
Okay.

174
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:52,884
Oh! And Jake?

175
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:53,927
Oh mom! C'mon on!

176
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:55,529
Really!

177
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,387
It's time for dinner.

178
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,681
Alright, alright... I'll be right there.

179
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,544
I hope I didn't wake the kids.

180
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,387
Oh god! They'll sleep thru anything.

181
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:32,966
So Maggie said that yesterday was
last time she saw them?

182
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,259
Yeah, just before noon.

183
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:37,387
She said Matt took the boat out to catch some bass.

184
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:40,139
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

185
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:42,725
Where's the boat?
- Over there.

186
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,407
You feeling like a skinnydip?

187
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,868
Yeah, I think we can make it to the end of the pier.

188
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:00,535
Meaning what?

189
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,020
I'm too old or I'm too heavy?

190
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,072
I think you're too chickenshit.

191
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,969
By the way, Gordon called last night.

192
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:09,961
Yeah?

193
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:14,507
He said the USGS recorded a heavy
seismic activity beneath the lake.

194
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:15,592
Really?

195
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,678
They're sending in a team of seismologist divers.

196
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:19,521
Alright!

197
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:22,599
And he said you will escort them out.

198
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:25,018
Jesus Christ.

199
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,761
Just been invaded by 20,000 kids...

200
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,230
makes us a little busy at the moment.

201
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,773
You know. That's what I told them.

202
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,777
This doesn't sound too good.

203
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:52,086
So what time is the divers...

204
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,046
gonna get here?

205
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:54,380
He said about 10.

206
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,234
Shit.

207
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:20,949
C'mon just a little more.

208
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,494
Can't get it.

209
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,587
Give me your hand!

210
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:44,506
You think a propeller could have done it?

211
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,265
I doubt it.

212
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,016
Look at the bones, nothing's broken.

213
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,435
It's like something acidic...

214
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:50,871
or toxic decomposition.

215
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,897
Well if the body's been in the water for weeks.

216
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,486
What would you say if I was thinking about closing the lake?

217
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:01,322
You know, just until we get an autopsy report.

218
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:04,242
The autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days.

219
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,112
It'll be easier to drain this lake then to close it.

220
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,372
It's a big financial week for our town.

221
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,168
Too old for this.

222
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,279
We're not lying to mom.

223
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,364
Yeah! We're not lying to mom.

224
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,323
Come on guys...

225
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:26,574
every year it's the same thing.

226
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:27,617
I'm stuck here with you guys while...

227
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:29,869
I miss all spring break fun.

228
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,996
You mean spring break boobies?

229
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:33,957
What if I give you guys the cash for babysitting?

230
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,042
Sixty dollars and you got a deal.

231
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,219
Sixty! I'm only getting paid forty!

232
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:40,129
Twenty dollars deception surcharge.

233
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:47,178
Do not pickup the phone.

234
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,179
Do not answer the door.

235
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,224
And do not leave the house.

236
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:52,726
Okay? I'm counting on you guys.

237
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:53,852
Alright?

238
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:25,884
Hi!

239
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:27,760
After the dive.

240
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
Our presence is requested at the Kokamo's.

241
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,514
By the Arizona State Cheerleading team.

242
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,649
Hi! I'm Sherffi Forester.

243
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:35,310
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

244
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,060
Very good to meet you.

245
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,854
I love the welcoming committee around here.

246
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:39,772
I assume that's technical equipment too?

247
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,066
Yes, Sam! Give those back.
C'mon.

248
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:44,944
According to the epicentre coordinates...

249
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,989
we need to go... here.

250
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:50,575
Okay.

251
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,994
It's about 20 minutes out.

252
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,162
Ready when you are.

253
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:55,205
Alright.

254
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:01,544
So you don't see many women working law
enforcement out here in cowboy country.

255
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:02,879
You see a lot of cowboys though.

256
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,339
Yeah, Sure.

257
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:41,394
Kelly!

258
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,020
Jake!

259
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,524
Who exactly are you babysitting here?

260
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,693
Well, it's a ...

261
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:50,361
It's a funny story actually, I...

262
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,404
I say tit!

263
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,572
You say eat!

264
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,032
Tit!
- Eat tit!

265
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:57,569
Look at those idiots.

266
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,412
It's a... terrible.

267
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:01,206
Sandrat!

268
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:02,816
Hey! Sandrat!

269
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:03,875
I'm talking to you.

270
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,918
SANDRAT!

271
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:05,260
Hello!

272
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,503
Where the hell have you been?

273
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:06,845
We got these girls souped up.

274
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,463
We're ready to roll!

275
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:09,356
I'm docking your paycheck!

276
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,965
C'mon! Let's go.

277
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,008
Okay!

278
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,722
Now I see what you've been
scouting in the last 15 minutes.

279
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:21,434
Well! Kelly it's nice to see you.
I know you gonna get going.

280
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:22,268
Kelly! Kelly.

281
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,062
Hi! I'm Derrick Jones.

282
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:25,104
Hi!

283
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,065
You know this guy?

284
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:28,608
Jake!

285
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,577
"Jake is my boy"!

286
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:31,903
Jake is the man with the plan!

287
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,346
The inside, the knowledge!

288
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:34,656
Yeah wait!

289
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:37,534
Those girls aren't with you,
are they?

290
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,537
Yeah! why? Are you into girls?

291
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,664
No, I'm just showing him around town...

292
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:44,332
ya know just all the hot spots.

293
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,375
Jake, jake, jake...

294
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,585
The job is called location scout and...

295
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,420
Kelly you should come with!

296
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,006
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

297
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:54,467
No! She's got other plans already.

298
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,678
Kelly do you like champagne?

299
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:03,226
I... I love champagne,

300
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,227
actually I love...

301
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:05,111
No, no, no! Wait a second!

302
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,231
I would love come on your boat Derrick,
thank you.

303
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:08,982
I mean...

304
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,900
Someone have to keep an eye
on the man with the plan here.

305
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,193
Right! Sand RAT!

306
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:13,236
C'mon, c'mon...

307
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,155
Let me... let me help you aboard.

308
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:16,447
Why! Why...

309
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:19,117
Hey! Todd, That's Kelly.

310
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,203
Hi Kelly! baby.

311
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:24,789
What happened to...

312
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,166
ya know hanging with us today?

313
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,917
Is that your boyfriend or something?
- No, no, no

314
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,210
He's just some guy from the school,

315
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,005
someone whom he said to have
backstage passes when he actually doesn't.

316
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:34,299
Have a good day Todd!
- C'mon Kelly!

317
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:35,800
Go on, have a T-shirt.

318
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:40,680
What the fuck?!

319
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,431
That's Derrick Jones...

320
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,391
Is it Jake Forrester?

321
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:46,102
Oh... fuck me...

322
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:48,646
Alright! We are off to shoot some wild porn...

323
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:53,151
royal like with these "Wild Wild Goddesses" !!

324
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:56,529
But we will see you all...

325
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,991
4 o'clock Canyon Beach for the Lake Victoria wet t-shirt...

326
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:03,870
"Wild Extravaganza"!!

327
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:06,247
We told Dave we would stay in the house.

328
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:07,957
We told Jack that we'll stay home.

329
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,502
I told him I'd fish.

330
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,587
I can't if there aren't any.

331
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:13,963
The lake too busy!.

332
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:16,049
C'mon! Sand Island is really close.

333
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:30,021
I should've brought my trombone.

334
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:34,234
No way! Girl! Sunbath or something.

335
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:36,402
Well when I become a rock star...

336
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:39,072
see if I like you be in one of my groupies.

337
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:41,449
Give me a break dude!

338
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:44,118
You PLAY the trombone!

339
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:56,673
Alright ladies here we go...

340
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:59,050
a little bubbly!
- Thank you.

341
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,801
Here you go!

342
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:02,971
Finest's your... Shinaz has to offer.

343
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:03,888
You're kidding.

344
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:07,058
Here we go... yeah!

345
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:08,101
Drink up. Crystal.

346
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:11,020
Yeah!
Join and cheers!

347
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,938
Cheers!

348
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:14,149
To our newest ''Wild Wild" Number.

349
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,443
You are beautiful.

350
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:20,363
That's why we came here.
Derrick wants to capture innocence.

351
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:22,365
It's all about innocence.

352
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,117
Just like her.

353
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,916
Alright! Derrick's just making his play.

354
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,335
He might as well ask me out to breathe.

355
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,089
Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

356
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:39,841
It's like a law of physics.

357
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,843
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

358
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,180
She's not messing up your party! Is she?

359
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,265
Like I care. She's not my girlfriend.

360
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,308
Oh! And...

361
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,060
I'm.. This is great. I'm having a great time...

362
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,803
We're... going wild...

363
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:55,064
I'm... going wild.

364
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:57,066
Hey, Jake! How far is this place?!

365
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,276
C'mon!

366
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:00,111
Yeah, yeah we're almost there!

367
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:04,073
So speaking of going wild?

368
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:07,410
You haven't seen anything yet.

369
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,642
Jake!

370
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,685
Jake.

371
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:33,728
Yeah?

372
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:38,274
Jake!

373
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:47,283
Why don't you put it somewhere...

374
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,202
Anyway you want.

375
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,082
Crystal! He's not even legal.

376
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:55,894
Hey, what's up guys?

377
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,104
Jake! Close that door! You're ruining our shot!

378
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:01,441
C'mon sandrat! Get with the program here.

379
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:02,859
Here they come, here they come!

380
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,611
Here come's my nymphs.

381
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:08,198
Oh my god!

382
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,533
Here we go!

383
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:13,495
Check it out!
The fish with boobies.

384
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,331
If fish looked like that! I would fuck fish!

385
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:18,249
I would only fuck fish!

386
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,918
Here we go...

387
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,586
Looking good ladies.

388
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:22,921
You like this right? Jake?

389
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,882
You're the one that should be paying us today,
not the other way around.

390
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,593
Zoom in. Zoom, zoom, zoom...

391
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:30,720
Get that ass.

392
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:33,765
Look at these Goddess of product...

393
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:34,974
bitches. This is hot Andy!

394
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:37,060
This is so hot! This is what it's all about!

395
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:41,439
Beer, sun and naked honeys making out underwater!

396
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:49,239
Better than any aquarium YOU been to sandrat!

397
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,119
Uh... mom! Hey! Umm...

398
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:55,862
Mom?

399
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,580
What... what's going on out over there? Cuz...

400
00:27:58,248 --> 00:27:59,290
Naked fishes!

401
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,001
Well then how come you didn't pickup the home phone?

402
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,753
Ya know! I've been trying to reach you.

403
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:05,880
Why? I... I...

404
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:07,298
I'm sorry we've just been outside.

405
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:10,385
But I... I can get them if you need me to.
- Crystal! spin around!

406
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,303
No, no that's okay.

407
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,142
Oh my god!

408
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:18,434
What?

409
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:22,272
Nothing, nothing it's just the...

410
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:23,982
It just the kids. They're...

411
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,734
Just pushed the tent outside and...

412
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:27,902
I... I...

413
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:30,572
It just really nice to see them...

414
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,657
to see them playing with each other.

415
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:35,201
Put you ass on the glass!

416
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:35,994
Yeah!

417
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:36,369
Your...cho...

418
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:37,412
Choucha!

419
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,330
Jake? Is someone there with you?

420
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:43,585
No, no, no. It's just the...

421
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,669
It's just the kids on the lake!

422
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,379
It's crazy here, you know how it is.

423
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:49,465
Honey, I do not want to Zane or Laura near the lake today,

424
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,508
Do you hear me?

425
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,677
Alright! Okay. We'll stay in and...

426
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:55,346
We'll watch some TV. Whatever's on okay!

427
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:59,184
Alright! I gonna go. Thank you so much for this.

428
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,686
I'll try really hard to be home early, okay?

429
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:04,022
Yeah. Alright, alright I love you.

430
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,064
Okay I gonna go!

431
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:08,401
Kelly?

432
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:15,116
Kelly, where are ya?!

433
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:22,248
Kelly?

434
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:27,420
Kelly?

435
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,676
Jake!

436
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:16,302
You just missed the rest of the big show!

437
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:19,889
There you go girls! Come on up!
Give 'em some towels!

438
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:24,769
Wow! Good work!

439
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:25,812
waste time for canoe.

440
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,731
I must've gotten my knots mixed up!

441
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:31,276
So you caught zero fish and you lose our only boat.

442
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:33,386
This sea is so full of accomplishment!

443
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,363
Jake is gonna kill us.

444
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:36,739
Somebody will see us.

445
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:39,033
Look! There's some boats just right over there!

446
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,828
Don't waste your time, they'll never see us.

447
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:42,871
They're way too far.

448
00:30:45,165 --> 00:30:46,749
Hello!

449
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,632
Hello!

450
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,942
We need some help!

451
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:14,277
Hey!

452
00:31:14,277 --> 00:31:15,820
We're over here!

453
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:18,531
Somebody please help us!

454
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:24,347
Look at the size of that!

455
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,975
What is it? A... a cavern system?

456
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:29,185
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

457
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,520
Probably bigger then the one above.

458
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,357
You see that gap right there?
- Yeah?

459
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:35,608
Quake open that one up.

460
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:38,078
Now it's a
connecting passage.

461
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,237
A lake under a lake.

462
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:39,880
That's right.

463
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:41,981
Sorry! It's still your jurisdiction.

464
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,367
It's part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

465
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,202
That's the beauty of it.

466
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:48,496
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

467
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:50,248
You got it.

468
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,792
I don't know why you get excited over that crap.

469
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:55,253
All I ever see is rocks and sand.

470
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:18,526
You should probably warn them
that it's not pretty down there.

471
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:21,237
Tourists treat this lake like it's a gabbage can.

472
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,282
How you guys doing?

473
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,576
Sheriff said that  it's a regular treasure trove down there.

474
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,077
So...!

475
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:30,246
I got debs on these spent bubbles,

476
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:32,790
bad body sprays and back issues of drugs.

477
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,084
I got debs on home appliances.

478
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:37,462
I got debs on missing college girls.

479
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,010
Oh my god.

480
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,222
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

481
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:50,225
Can you keep your mind on the task at hand.

482
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,317
It's at least 100 feet Novak!

483
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:06,991
Almost full visibility.

484
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:08,576
Descending fissure!

485
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:11,496
My PO2 is set at 1. 1.3.

486
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,290
You should see this.

487
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,709
It's unbelievable.

488
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:19,921
Novak, do you copy?

489
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:20,964
Yeah! Pretty good.

490
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:30,306
Okay guys you are about 90 feet to the
entrance of the connecting passage.

491
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:36,521
Looks like single file time!

492
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:37,605
I'll go first.

493
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:39,899
No! I should do the prelim scout.

494
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,985
Your fat ass will get us stuck.

495
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:43,862
Baby! I'm like an eel.

496
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:44,654
I'm electric eel.

497
00:34:45,446 --> 00:34:46,823
I get into such tight spaces.

498
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:47,866
It's shocking.

499
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,076
Huh! That's weird?

500
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,288
Here they are... but they're spiltting up.

501
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,251
Guys?

502
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:02,297
Everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

503
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:17,187
I'm heading a serious drop in temperature here.

504
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:18,646
It's at least 30 degrees colder.

505
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:21,649
You're probably at the mountain near the water lake.

506
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,570
Do you have any visual?

507
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:30,033
I'm entering the cave.

508
00:35:52,972 --> 00:35:54,724
Jesus!

509
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:56,810
This thing seems endless.

510
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:11,374
You gotta see this.

511
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:12,951
This is incredible.

512
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,930
Sam! What are you seeing down there?

513
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,392
Something bit me!

514
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,938
Oh yeah, right! I thought you always love that kinda stuff.

515
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,744
Sam! Sam!

516
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,078
Sam! Answer me!

517
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:40,121
SAM!

518
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:41,164
Sam!

519
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:55,345
Something's happening.

520
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,222
What? You mean aftershock?
- I don't know...

521
00:37:57,222 --> 00:37:58,264
Give me my flippers.

522
00:38:46,521 --> 00:38:47,939
OH MY GOD!

523
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:17,260
Your body is a temple.

524
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:20,221
And now it is time to give thanks to the gods.

525
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,766
Andrew, roll camera!

526
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:24,559
Kelly, you're up! C'mon!

527
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,227
Me! No! no, no...

528
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,022
No, thanks. I think very had to drink too much.

529
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,982
Please! You don't want to worship this beautiful altar?!
- C'mon...

530
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,234
I know you're partial to the champagne,

531
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,653
but believe us you can trust Crystal right?

532
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:37,822
Hey! C'mon Derrick, she... she said no.

533
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:38,465
No...

534
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,366
She said no thanks...

535
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:41,242
There's a difference...

536
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:44,412
She understands gratitude is the right attitude.

537
00:39:44,996 --> 00:39:46,080
Kelly!

538
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,915
Trust us!

539
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,550
It... It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

540
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,001
Yeah! C'mon try it!
- C'mon.

541
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,461
Sure!

542
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,504
Have fun!

543
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:55,524
Yeah! Jake! You're not gonna take away the fun now?

544
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:59,719
Like I said... she's not my girlfriend.

545
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,223
Fine! I'll do it.

546
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,557
Okay!
- Yeah!

547
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:05,475
Okay!

548
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:06,218
Here we go!

549
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:07,977
First, you lick this salt.

550
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:08,920
Here we go!
- Okay!

551
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,371
C'mon over here!

552
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,149
Then you suck up the tequila.

553
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:15,902
Here we go! Sorry about that
Crystal!

554
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:16,945
Here's your vitamin C!

555
00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:18,905
Gonna get your lime!

556
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:20,949
Kelly! You don't have to do this.

557
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:23,326
I really don't think I need any
of your babysitting here. Jake!

558
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:25,870
Rachel!

559
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:30,625
Okay.

560
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,918
Okay.

561
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,221
Yeah!...

562
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:57,277
Alright! alright...

563
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:58,528
Let's switch places!

564
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,571
Good job Kelly!

565
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:00,029
Jake you're up!

566
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,364
Derrick excuse me! Up a little bit.

567
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,283
How bout we try Jake and Kelly?

568
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:04,033
What?
- What?

569
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:05,034
No! I don't think she.
- No! I don't think...

570
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:06,077
Oh! C'mon Derrick.

571
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,787
C'mon guys, we'll shooting...

572
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:09,706
porno not a drama. Let's make a decision.

573
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:10,915
C'mon.

574
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,252
Fuck it! Sandrat...
Let's roll, c'mon!

575
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,045
There you go! Thank you Crystal!

576
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:18,256
C'mon Kelly. Come on up here.

577
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:20,425
Come on by the bed!

578
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:21,467
There we go!

579
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:24,471
Let's get you some salt!

580
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:28,808
A little bit of tequila!

581
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:29,976
Okay!

582
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:31,019
Yeah!

583
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:32,979
And... You're live!

584
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:33,730
Okay! okay!

585
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,564
Roll, roll, roll...

586
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:35,607
Roll!

587
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:55,376
Sandrat! Sandrat!...

588
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:08,389
Mr. Goodman?

589
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,433
Mr. Goodman!

590
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:13,770
I'm coming!

591
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,606
I'm coming, hold your horses!

592
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,568
The store is closed!

593
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:31,704
I want to know what the hell
this thing is doing in my lake!

594
00:42:33,623 --> 00:42:35,291
Where did you get this?

595
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:37,085
Oh! In the middle of the lake.

596
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:39,629
Where they're two people dead!

597
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:45,385
Oh my...

598
00:42:45,927 --> 00:42:46,761
Oh my! Yeah! That's right...

599
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:47,887
Oh my, oh my.

600
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,305
Excuse me!

601
00:42:49,472 --> 00:42:50,181
But!

602
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,808
Is that a fucking Piranha?

603
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:53,685
Carl! Not the only one.

604
00:42:53,685 --> 00:42:54,644
Yeah! here, here, here, look at these...

605
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:55,687
There are thousands of them.

606
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,014
Thousands! And they're pissed.

607
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,724
You know I have heard of these happening.

608
00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:02,527
It's like those alligators in New Jersey,

609
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,612
Someone leaves them and then they breed!

610
00:43:04,612 --> 00:43:05,989
What?
- No...!

611
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:08,825
Who release this fish into the lake...

612
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,743
What are you talking about?

613
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:12,004
THIS!

614
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:13,997
Particular piranha,

615
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,124
Vanished! Off the face of the earth!

616
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:19,752
More than two million years ago!

617
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:23,882
Emm... Where's he going?

618
00:43:29,345 --> 00:43:30,472
Allow me...

619
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,308
to introduce...

620
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:39,856
The "Pygocentrus Nattereri"

621
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:42,108
The regional Piranha!

622
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:45,695
They used to swim the entire Colorado river.

623
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:49,657
Right until the Piscusus epic .

624
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:53,703
I still don't understand how you found one.

625
00:43:56,498 --> 00:43:57,540
Alive!

626
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:00,585
We discovered a subterreanean lake through a rift,

627
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:02,045
caused by the quake.
- But!

628
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:06,424
How could it survived for so long,

629
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:06,925
cut out from the surface?

630
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:08,468
Cannibalism.

631
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:12,480
They must have fought each other to survive.

632
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:13,807
Look!

633
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:19,270
All those scars, on her scales.

634
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:22,899
Notice! The eyes.

635
00:44:23,024 --> 00:44:25,485
Jesus. Like he's staring back at you.

636
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:28,488
No, no, no! Not staring...

637
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:30,698
sensing!

638
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:39,499
God! Don't do that!

639
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:42,919
Piranhas hunt in packs.

640
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:44,212
Not for protection!

641
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,840
But overwhelming force.

642
00:44:47,757 --> 00:44:50,510
They're organized, methodical...

643
00:44:51,803 --> 00:44:54,430
The first bite draws blood,

644
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,724
more blood draws the pack!

645
00:44:57,475 --> 00:44:59,477
So how are we going to stop them?

646
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:02,605
Wait. I'm sorry, you're not actually
consider going back out onto the lake?

647
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:05,191
They are killing machines but they're still fish.

648
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,359
You can catch them

649
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,570
or kill them!

650
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:11,698
If there really are thousands...

651
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:12,740
Ya?

652
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:16,619
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

653
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:29,776
Oh Shit!

654
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,804
It's my little brother and sister!

655
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:34,364
Are they waving for help?

656
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:37,492
I don't know. They are supposed to be at home right now.

657
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:38,535
I'm supposed to be home right now!

658
00:46:38,993 --> 00:46:40,286
Jake, jake, jake.

659
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:41,821
What are you doing?! You're gonna miss my money shot!

660
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:43,540
Okay. It's my family! Alright!

661
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,582
They could be in trouble!

662
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:47,210
You are gonna be the one in trouble,

663
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,171
if I don't get my flying catars right now!

664
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:52,006
What the hell's wrong with you man?

665
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,637
What's wrong with me?

666
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:01,474
Oh, God dammit! You're missing it.
You're missing it...

667
00:47:01,474 --> 00:47:03,017
You're missing the shot!

668
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:05,829
No, no, no...

669
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:09,149
Wow! You missed it! What is wrong with you?

670
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,376
Listen! They are stranded out there okay!

671
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,836
They might need my help.

672
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:15,363
Boobies, boobies...

673
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:15,905
Alright!

674
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:16,698
Listen to me.

675
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:19,534
My mom is the Sheriff.

676
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:36,134
Alright! Let's...

677
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:37,719
swing by the island!

678
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:38,761
Throw the minerals in the boat!

679
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:40,763
It'll be great!

680
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:41,848
It'll be fun.

681
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:08,958
Take me up!

682
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:22,263
Help me!

683
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:23,306
Take me up!

684
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:24,641
What the hell is goin on?

685
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:08,852
Weapons of mass offensive right over here!

686
00:49:09,227 --> 00:49:10,228
Let's see those dance.

687
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,729
Alright girls!

688
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:14,023
Shake those booties!

689
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:15,066
Shake those Hoolas!

690
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,235
Willy Wonka and those chocolate factory!

691
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,592
Yes, I need the National Guard...

692
00:49:41,092 --> 00:49:41,885
I need the Coast Guard.

693
00:49:41,885 --> 00:49:44,471
I need all the forces in your power to deploy!

694
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:48,183
Everybody back to the beach!

695
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:50,977
Move back to the dock! Everybody!

696
00:49:50,977 --> 00:49:52,020
Move back!

697
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:12,916
Don't talk about Satan. Just take your boat back.

698
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:15,126
No more talk about Satan.
Please!

699
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,713
Fuck them!

700
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:24,093
What the fuck?

701
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:36,314
This is the Lake Victoria sheriff's department.

702
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:40,735
The Sheriff has declared an emergency.

703
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,862
Don't worry, we got beer over here!

704
00:50:43,947 --> 00:50:45,615
Geronimo!

705
00:50:47,408 --> 00:50:48,743
Hi! Get on out over there.

706
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:51,496
I need you out of the water now!

707
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,039
Yeah!

708
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,624
Hit it DJ Chocolate Thunder!

709
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:30,076
Is that Jake? Why is he here?

710
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,952
I don't know.

711
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:32,912
We're so busted.
- No!

712
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:33,663
He is.

713
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:35,456
I didn't even catch any fish!

714
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:36,499
Slow down.

715
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:39,502
Slow down!
Okay! I know what I'm doing... alright!

716
00:51:39,502 --> 00:51:41,504
Careful! It's not that deep!

717
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:44,340
We're busted.

718
00:51:49,095 --> 00:51:50,847
Okay Jake! I'm not taking the fall for this.

719
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:51,890
It was all Zane's idea.

720
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:55,143
I paid you $60 bucks to stay home.

721
00:51:55,143 --> 00:51:56,060
What do you mean!

722
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,353
How bout 40 we're call it even.

723
00:51:57,353 --> 00:51:59,522
How bout you get on this boat and we go home!

724
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:00,690
End of story!

725
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,944
Just get on the boat!

726
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:06,779
Woah, woah, woah!
- We should've been at Canyon Beach

727
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,540
an hour ago for the mother fucking main event!

728
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:11,618
C'mon!
- Alright! Go ahead! Speedo!

729
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:13,328
Be careful getting outta here!

730
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,788
the rocks sometimes circulate the engine!

731
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:25,590
I want you to rest somehow, okay!

732
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,925
And keep Zane and Laura with you

733
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:28,802
I don't want them anywhere near Derrick.

734
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,763
Wow! The water is just so clear.

735
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:38,186
What kind of fish was that?

736
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:39,646
I don't know.

737
00:52:40,104 --> 00:52:41,981
I'm gonna make them take us
home right now okay.

738
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:45,819
What is that?

739
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:47,320
What happened?

740
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:50,698
Are you guys okay?

741
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,243
I think we hit something.

742
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:03,294
Andrew! what hell's going on now?

743
00:53:04,254 --> 00:53:06,172
I don't know! We're stuck on something!

744
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:08,133
Well! Fix it god dammit! Fix it!

745
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,717
There are rocks everywhere!

746
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:11,177
Yeah! There're rocks down here!

747
00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:13,096
What happened?

748
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,473
God! I think something caught on the prop (rotors).

749
00:53:16,766 --> 00:53:18,226
Okay, stay put!

750
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:19,561
Alright.

751
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:21,271
Crystal, get the sandrat up here.

752
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:24,357
I said get the fucking sandrat up here!

753
00:53:24,357 --> 00:53:25,608
What's wrong with you!
- Hey!

754
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:28,611
Why didn't you go get him yourself?

755
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:38,930
I just got here thinking...

756
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:42,125
how this whole fucked up day has been your fault.

757
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:44,294
Wanna help me with the new bitch?

758
00:53:44,919 --> 00:53:47,130
Don't do a fucking thing I tell you...

759
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,007
you take us way the fuck off course!

760
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:51,134
I... I...

761
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:52,343
I... get it.

762
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:53,803
You're, you're new at this.

763
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:56,306
I'm, I'm cool with that man. Really!

764
00:53:56,306 --> 00:53:57,348
I am... but, but...

765
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,600
But what you do to me...

766
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:01,352
What this is...

767
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,396
Aarg! There is a word for it ...

768
00:54:03,396 --> 00:54:05,106
It's a... it's a...

769
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:05,940
It's a boat word...

770
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,358
What is it? Ah...

771
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:09,569
Mutiny.

772
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:10,612
Is that what it is ?

773
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:12,655
Is this a Mutiny?

774
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:14,449
Relax Derrick. Okay.

775
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:15,783
I'm just...

776
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:16,826
I'm just going a bit wild.

777
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:25,793
If anyone should down there helping,

778
00:54:25,793 --> 00:54:27,295

779

Let me do it!

783
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:45,104
I need everybody out of the water now!

784
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:47,857
Get out of water! This is an emergency!

785
00:54:47,857 --> 00:54:49,651
Get out of water now!

786
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:28,875
C'mon!

Oh my god!

792
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,126
Oh my god!

793
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:12,854
Where are you going?

794
00:58:14,355 --> 00:58:15,523
Where are you going?

795
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:17,650
Throw me the gun!

796
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,693
It's fully loaded!

797
00:58:31,748 --> 00:58:32,790
Get out of the water!

798

Thank you!

799
00:58:34,918 --> 00:58:35,960
Don't let go!

800

Okay!

801
00:58:39,672 --> 00:58:41,466
Swim to shore! Get off the beach!

802
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,467
Get out of the water!

803

00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:56,564
Fuck it! You're slipping!

00:59:39,149 --> 00:59:40,650
I'm taking you to shore!

811
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,693
Hold on!

812
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,959

Okay!

823
01:01:28,466 --> 01:01:30,343
Hey! C'mon! You're gonna kill the engine!

824
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,053
C'mon!

825
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:34,347
Derrick! Hey!

826
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:39,310

827
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:42,355

Yeah...!

834
01:02:26,816 --> 01:02:27,859
Hell...

835
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:42,290
Holy shit!

836
01:03:04,062 --> 01:03:05,939
Let's go!

837
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,149
Hey! You guys okay?

838
01:03:09,108 --> 01:03:10,068
You okay?
- Yeah!

839
01:03:10,068 --> 01:03:12,403
Alright! Where's Kelly?

840
01:03:12,403 --> 01:03:13,279
Down there!

841
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:14,137
There.

842
01:03:15,698 --> 01:03:16,691
Kelly!

843
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:18,535
Kelly!

844
01:03:18,952 --> 01:03:19,936
Jake!

845
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:23,832
Get off the floor Kelly!

846
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:25,708
Get out!

847
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,627
I'm gonna will find a way to your floor!

848
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:29,087
And get you to the skylight!

849
01:03:29,087 --> 01:03:30,130
Hurry up!

850
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:41,307
Hurry up your stupidness! C'mon!

851
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,571
Jake!

852
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:10,962
Okay guys! C'mon, c'mon!

853
01:04:10,962 --> 01:04:12,672
Get over there! I don't want you to see this!

854
01:04:28,188 --> 01:04:29,564
They... they took my penis!

855
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:31,483
They took my penis!

856
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:41,868
Jake! hurry up! They're here!

857
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:47,440
Jake!

858
01:04:47,457 --> 01:04:48,374
Kelly!

859
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:51,586
Hurry up!

860
01:04:51,586 --> 01:04:53,597
Can you reach the skylight?

861
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,552
Jake!

862
01:06:52,457 --> 01:06:54,542
C'mon, c'mon dude!

863
01:06:58,213 --> 01:06:59,255
Everybody get out!

864
01:07:06,304 --> 01:07:07,472
Everybody jump to the shore!

865
01:07:07,472 --> 01:07:08,515
Get to the shore!

866
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:24,864
Everybody out!

867
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,128
No! No!

868
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:39,879
No!

869
01:08:11,995 --> 01:08:13,037
Hold this tight.

870
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:18,334
This is Sheriff Forester.

871
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:21,044
Mom?
- Jake!

872
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:22,714
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

873
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:23,381
What?

874
01:08:24,215 --> 01:08:25,592
Where's Lauren and Zane?

875
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,051
They're with me on the boat.

876
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:28,470
Oh my god! Jake.

877
01:08:29,179 --> 01:08:31,014
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

878
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:33,892
You do not understand, Mom! Our boat is sinking!

879
01:08:35,018 --> 01:08:36,060
What?...

880
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:40,231
Where are you?

881
01:08:42,108 --> 01:08:43,026
What are you doing?

882
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,001
I'm coming with ya.

883
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:01,377
Let's go.

884
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:25,276
That's mom.

885
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:27,403
Mom!

886
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:28,655
Hey!

887
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:31,074
Stuck in rocks!
- Yeah!

888
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,369
How're gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.

889
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:36,287
Use the rope.

890
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:37,330
Here! They gonna reach!

891
01:09:37,622 --> 01:09:38,665
It's got to.

892
01:09:38,998 --> 01:09:41,126
Jake! I'm gonna throw you the rope!

893
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:42,794
Attach it to the highest railing!

894
01:09:42,836 --> 01:09:43,837
Okay, mom!

895
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,965
Back it up.
- Yup.

896
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,636
Back it up this way.

897
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,474
Watch out for rocks!

898
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,977
Yo! Watch out!

899
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:00,270
Kay! You ready?

900
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,312
Yeah!

901
01:10:04,566 --> 01:10:06,609
Okay! That's good, that's good! don't go too far!

902
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:07,652
Okay!

903
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:10,363
Yeah!

904
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,294
Keep the CB on the police frequency.

905
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:25,336
I've got my radio.

906
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:28,173
Okay! Just get there!

907
01:10:40,935 --> 01:10:41,978
Mom!

908
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:45,690
Mom, are you okay?

909
01:10:50,695 --> 01:10:52,405
Is this everybody on the boat?

910
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:55,325
No! Kelly is still stuck down there in the cabin,

911
01:10:55,325 --> 01:10:56,326
we can't get her out!

912
01:10:56,326 --> 01:10:57,368
We can't get her out!

913
01:10:57,442 --> 01:10:58,361
Kelly?

914
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,329
God!

915
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:00,647
Kelly!

916
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:02,999
Julie? Oh my god! Hey!

917
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:04,959
You gotta help me.

918
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,044
Can you grab my arm?

919
01:11:06,252 --> 01:11:08,405
You gonna help me get out of here.
The water's getting higher!

920
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:11,508
Can you reach the skylight?
- You better hurry! I'm fucking stuck!

921
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:12,592
Julie!

922
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:13,885
You think I'd didn't try to pry that thing!

923
01:11:13,885 --> 01:11:14,928
God dammit!

924
01:11:15,553 --> 01:11:16,596
Jake!

925
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,807
You guys! I'm scared!

926
01:11:19,224 --> 01:11:20,600
Please help!

927
01:11:22,393 --> 01:11:23,895
Mom, we have to hurry!

928
01:11:24,187 --> 01:11:25,230
Kelly?

929
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:26,556
Kelly!

930
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:27,690
We all gonna die?

931
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,484
We're not gonna die. Okay!

932
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:39,369
I need your help! Please!

933
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:40,912
Jake!

934
01:11:41,246 --> 01:11:43,248
The only way to get through to her is the bottom of the boat.

935
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:44,415
Get to the rope.

936
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,167
What are you talking about?

937
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,836
We can't just leave her down there!

938
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,921
Once I get everyone across on the rope...

939
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:51,381
I'm gonna come back for her!

940
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,842
No! I'm not gonna leave without! Mom!

941
01:11:53,883 --> 01:11:54,801
Jesus Christ! Jake!

942
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:56,094
The only way to get to her!

943
01:11:56,094 --> 01:11:58,304
Is for you to get into the water and
I'm not gonna let you do that!

944
01:11:58,304 --> 01:11:59,430
Now! C'mon and get on the boat...

945
01:11:59,472 --> 01:12:01,099
Listen to me! The reason she came on this boat!

946
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,475
Was because of me! Okay!

947
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:04,018
It's MY fault!

948
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:08,898
I'm not coming without her...

949
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:11,109
Okay! This rope ain't gonna hold much longer!

950
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:12,152
Let's go!

951
01:12:13,903 --> 01:12:16,698
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and
I'm coming back!

952
01:12:17,323 --> 01:12:19,159
And we're gonna do it together.

953
01:12:19,617 --> 01:12:20,702
Alright.

954
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:23,371
Alright! We're gonna keep two of them between us.

955
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:24,831
You gonna go first.

956
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,332
Can you do this?

957
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:29,711
Better believe it. Got my pull-ons for nothing.

958
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,758
You have a lot of explaining to do.

959
01:12:37,677 --> 01:12:39,262
Okay, ready?

960
01:12:46,769 --> 01:12:49,105
Okay! Be careful! Don't look down! Let's go!

961
01:12:57,572 --> 01:12:59,407
Just like the playground...

962
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:01,451
Hand over hand.

963
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,288
Don't look down.

964
01:13:06,706 --> 01:13:08,124
Don't look down, alright!

965
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,544
Keep going. C'mon! You can do it.

966
01:13:11,878 --> 01:13:13,046
Hand over hand!

967
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:14,088
I'm scared!

968
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:19,177
Keep going!

969
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:23,181
Careful.

970
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:25,141
Don't look down.

971
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:26,309
Okay!

972
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:27,352
Oh god!

973
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:32,565
They're biting me!

974
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:35,026
Oh god!

975
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:42,867
Get off me!

976
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:57,298
No! No! NO!

977
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:04,389
God dammit!

978
01:14:11,688 --> 01:14:12,939
Listen to me! Both of you!

979
01:14:13,606 --> 01:14:14,899
If you move fast!

980
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:16,109
It will NOT get you.

981
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:17,986
You have to move NOW!

982
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:19,571
Come on! MOVE IT!

983
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:20,613
You can do it!

984
01:14:20,864 --> 01:14:21,906
GO!

985
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:25,285
Keep moving now!

986
01:14:29,706 --> 01:14:30,748
Keep going!

987
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:32,500
Okay guys!

988
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,836
Good! You're here!

989
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:39,174
Good going you guys did it!

990
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:45,805
Dammit!

991
01:14:51,811 --> 01:14:53,897
C'mon mom! Keep moving!

992
01:14:58,568 --> 01:14:59,527
You okay?

993
01:14:59,777 --> 01:15:01,029
Cut the engine!

994
01:15:02,614 --> 01:15:03,406
What are you doing?

995
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,117
Jake! What are you doing?

996
01:15:09,078 --> 01:15:10,205
What are you doing?!

997
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,164
Jake!

998
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:13,016
Jake! Do not do that!
- Please!

999
01:15:13,049 --> 01:15:15,043
After all they want blood right?

1000
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,586
Let's give it to them.

1001
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,516
Wet T-shirt...

1002
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,893
Wet T-shirt...

1003
01:16:53,892 --> 01:16:54,058
Jake!

1004
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:57,437
Oh my god!

1005
01:17:00,565 --> 01:17:01,274
We're getting outta of here. Okay!

1006
01:17:01,274 --> 01:17:02,317
Both of us!

1007
01:17:04,027 --> 01:17:04,736
Okay I'm in!

1008
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:06,154
I need you guys to pull us out!

1009
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,489
As fast as possible.

1010
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:08,406
Do you copy?

1011
01:17:08,406 --> 01:17:09,991
Okay! We're ready when you are.

1012
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:18,458
Jake! What are you doing?
They're gonna come back!

1013
01:17:18,549 --> 01:17:21,085
I gave them a scare okay! That's gonna
hold them off for at least...

1014
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,837
couple of minutes.

1015
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:29,761
Okay! I need you to tie these together okay!
- Why?

1016
01:17:29,761 --> 01:17:30,970
Just do it!

1017
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:32,931

1018
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:36,976

1019
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:59,207
I need to you to hold your breath...

1020
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,460

of the bottom of the boat. Okay!

1021
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:04,087
And I need you to hold on tight!

1022
01:18:04,087 --> 01:18:05,547
Can you hold on TIGHT to me?

1023
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:09,676
Alright...

1024
01:18:11,136 --> 01:18:13,471

1025
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:14,514
Do you guys copy?!

1026
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:16,057
Copy that! Ten seconds on your signal.

1027
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:17,433
Get the kids down.

1028
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,072
10.

1029
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:49,757
6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

1030
01:18:50,717 --> 01:18:53,928
... 3 ... 2 ... 1

1031
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,772
Eh...! What's wrong?

1032
01:19:05,732 --> 01:19:06,774
C'mon!

1033
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:07,817
Stuck!

1034
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:10,028
Rud clear!

1035
01:19:10,153 --> 01:19:11,196
God dammit!

1036
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:12,138
Is it in gear?

1037
01:19:12,197 --> 01:19:12,739
No!

1038
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:13,682
C'mon!

1039
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:16,534
C'mon! You fucking thing!

1040
01:19:26,377 --> 01:19:28,296
It's gotta work! It's gotta work!

1041
01:19:56,074 --> 01:19:57,200
Oh my god!

1042
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,285
Holy shit!

1043
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:19,889

01:20:33,736 --> 01:20:34,529
Breathe! You're okay!

01:20:35,113 --> 01:20:36,156
You're okay!

1050
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:38,449
You're okay!

1051
01:20:38,741 --> 01:20:39,784
You're okay!

1052
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:40,618
Oh my god!

1053
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:41,995
Glad to have you on board!

1054
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:43,037
Jesus Christ!

1055
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:45,623
Holy shit!

1056
01:20:50,128 --> 01:20:51,921
Look! Mom! Over here!

1057
01:20:53,256 --> 01:20:54,340
They died!

1058
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,051
They're all dead!

1059
01:21:11,774 --> 01:21:13,026
You did it Jake!

1060
01:21:13,276 --> 01:21:14,527
I did!

1061
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:15,653
It worked!

1062
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:18,990
Hey! I thought dynamite fishing was
illegal in these parts sheriff?

1063
01:21:20,283 --> 01:21:21,360
Sheriff?

1064
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:22,443
Sheriff?

1065
01:21:23,328 --> 01:21:24,621
Yeah! This is Julie!

1066
01:21:26,331 --> 01:21:27,624
Julie... this is Carl.

1067
01:21:27,665 --> 01:21:30,043
We have a major problem.

1068
01:21:30,043 --> 01:21:32,837
Well! I am looking out at a school of dead piranhas.

1069
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:34,856
Not all of them but I think it's a good start.

1070
01:21:34,906 --> 01:21:36,949
You don't understand.

1071
01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:39,886
The specimen you left with me...

1072
01:21:39,886 --> 01:21:43,848
has no mature reproductive organs.

1073
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:46,100
What?

1074
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,520
What are you talking about?

1075
01:21:49,187 --> 01:21:52,023
The piranhas that killed those divers...

1076
01:21:52,023 --> 01:21:53,566
the ones you're hurting for...

1077
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:56,820
They are not fully developed.

1078
01:21:57,195 --> 01:21:59,197
They're the babies!

1079
01:22:02,367 --> 01:22:03,827
Babies?

1080
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:06,412
huh...

1081
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:08,248
So?

1082
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:11,501
Where are the parents?
